I'd never given much thought to how I would die —
though I'd had reason enough in the last few months
— but even if I had, I would not have imagined it like
this.
I stared without breathing across the long room, into
the dark eyes of the hunter, and he looked pleasantly
back at me.
Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of
someone else, someone I loved. Noble, even. That
ought to count for something.
I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be
facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't
bring myself to regret the decision. When life offers
you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations,
it's not reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end.
The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered
forward to kill me.

FIRST SIGHT
My mother drove me to the airport with the windows
rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in Phoenix,
the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my
favorite shirt — sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was
wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was
a parka.
In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington
State, a small town named Forks exists under a nearconstant cover of clouds. It rains on this
inconsequential town more than any other place in
the United States of America. It was from this town
and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother
escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It
was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend a
month every summer until I was fourteen. That was
the year I finally put my foot down; these past three
summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in
California for two weeks instead.
It was to Forks that I now exiled myself— an action
that I took with great horror. I detested Forks.
I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering
heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city.
"Bella," my mom said to me — the last of a thousand
times — before I got on the plane. "You don't have to
do this."
4 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
My mom looks like me, except with short hair and
laugh lines. I felt a spasm of panic as I stared at her
wide, childlike eyes. How could I leave my loving,
erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of
course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably
get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas
in her car, and someone to call when she got lost, but
still…
"I want to go," I lied. I'd always been a bad liar, but I'd
been saying this lie so frequently lately that it
sounded almost convincing now.
"Tell Charlie I said hi."
"I will."
"I'll see you soon," she insisted. "You can come home
whenever you want — I'll come right back as soon as
you need me."
But I could see the sacrifice in her eyes behind the
promise.
"Don't worry about me," I urged. "It'll be great. I love
you, Mom." She hugged me tightly for a minute, and
then I got on the plane, and she was gone.
It's a four-hour flight from Phoenix to Seattle, another
hour in a small plane up to Port Angeles, and then an
hour drive back down to Forks. Flying doesn't bother
me; the hour in the car with Charlie, though, I was a
little worried about.
Charlie had really been fairly nice about the whole
thing. He seemed genuinely pleased that I was coming
to live with him for the first time with any degree of
5 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
permanence. He'd already gotten me registered for
high school and was going to help me get a car.
But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie. Neither
of us was what anyone would call verbose, and I
didn't know what there was to say regardless. I knew
he was more than a little confused by my decision —
like my mother before me, I hadn't made a secret of
my distaste for Forks. When I landed in Port Angeles,
it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen — just
unavoidable. I'd already said my goodbyes to the sun.
Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I
was expecting, too. Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the
good people of Forks. My primary motivation behind
buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, was
that I refused to be driven around town in a car with
red and blue lights on top. Nothing slows down traffic
like a cop.
Charlie gave me an awkward, one-armed hug when I
stumbled my way off the plane.
"It's good to see you, Bells," he said, smiling as he
automatically caught and steadied me. "You haven't
changed much. How's Renée?"
"Mom's fine. It's good to see you, too, Dad." I wasn't
allowed to call him Charlie to his face.
I had only a few bags. Most of my Arizona clothes
were too permeable for Washington. My mom and I
had pooled our resources to supplement my winter
wardrobe, but it was still scanty. It all fit easily into
the trunk of the cruiser.
6 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"I found a good car for you, really cheap," he
announced when we were strapped in.
"What kind of car?" I was suspicious of the way he
said "good car for you" as opposed to just "good car."
"Well, it's a truck actually, a Chevy."
"Where did you find it?"
"Do you remember Billy Black down at La Push?" La
Push is the tiny Indian reservation on the coast.
"No."
"He used to go fishing with us during the summer,"
Charlie prompted. That would explain why I didn't
remember him. I do a good job of blocking painful,
unnecessary things from my memory.
"He's in a wheelchair now," Charlie continued when I
didn't respond, "so he can't drive anymore, and he
offered to sell me his truck cheap."
"What year is it?" I could see from his change of
expression that this was the question he was hoping I
wouldn't ask.
"Well, Billy's done a lot of work on the engine — it's
only a few years old, really."
I hoped he didn't think so little of me as to believe I
would give up that easily. "When did he buy it?"
"He bought it in 1984, I think."
"Did he buy it new?"
7 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Well, no. I think it was new in the early sixties — or
late fifties at the earliest," he admitted sheepishly.
"Ch — Dad, I don't really know anything about cars. I
wouldn't be able to fix it if anything went wrong, and I
couldn't afford a mechanic…"
"Really, Bella, the thing runs great. They don't build
them like that anymore."
The thing, I thought to myself… it had possibilities —
as a nickname, at the very least.
"How cheap is cheap?" After all, that was the part I
couldn't compromise on.
"Well, honey, I kind of already bought it for you. As a
homecoming gift." Charlie peeked sideways at me with
a hopeful expression.
Wow. Free.
"You didn't need to do that, Dad. I was going to buy
myself a car."
"I don't mind. I want you to be happy here." He was
looking ahead at the road when he said this. Charlie
wasn't comfortable with expressing his emotions out
loud. I inherited that from him. So I was looking
straight ahead as I responded.
"That's really nice, Dad. Thanks. I really appreciate
it." No need to add that my being happy in Forks is an
impossibility. He didn't need to suffer along with me.
And I never looked a free truck in the mouth — or
engine.
8 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Well, now, you're welcome," he mumbled,
embarrassed by my thanks. We exchanged a few more
comments on the weather, which was wet, and that
was pretty much it for Conversation. We stared out
the windows in silence. It was beautiful, of course; I
couldn't deny that. Everything was green: the trees,
their trunks covered with moss, their branches
hanging with a canopy of it, the ground covered with
ferns. Even the air filtered down greenly through the
leaves.
It was too green — an alien planet.
Eventually we made it to Charlie's. He still lived in the
small, two-bedroom house that he'd bought with my
mother in the early days of their marriage. Those were
the only kind of days their marriage had — the early
ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house
that never changed, was my new — well, new to me —
truck. It was a faded red color, with big, rounded
fenders and a bulbous cab. To my intense surprise, I
loved it. I didn't know if it would run, but I could see
myself in it. Plus, it was one of those solid iron affairs
that never gets damaged — the kind you see at the
scene of an accident, paint unscratched, surrounded
by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed.
"Wow, Dad, I love it! Thanks!" Now my horrific day
tomorrow would be just that much less dreadful. I
wouldn't be faced with the choice of either walking
two miles in the rain to school or accepting a ride in
the Chief's cruiser.
"I'm glad you like it," Charlie said gruffly,
embarrassed again. It took only one trip to get all my
9 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
stuff upstairs. I got the west bedroom that faced out
over the front yard. The room was familiar; it had
been belonged to me since I was born. The wooden
floor, the light blue walls, the peaked ceiling, the
yellowed lace curtains around the window —
these were all a part of my childhood. The only
changes Charlie had ever made were switching the
crib for a bed and adding a desk as I grew. The desk
now held a secondhand computer, with the phone
line for the modem stapled along the floor to the
nearest phone jack. This was a stipulation from my
mother, so that we could stay in touch easily. The
rocking chair from my baby days was still in the
corner.
There was only one small bathroom at the top of the
stairs, which I would have to share with Charlie. I
was trying not to dwell too much on that fact.
One of the best things about Charlie is he doesn't
hover. He left me alone to unpack and get settled, a
feat that would have been altogether impossible for
my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to
smile and look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out
the window at the sheeting rain and let just a few
tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to go on a real
crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I
would have to think about the coming morning.
Forks High School had a frightening total of only
three hundred and fifty-seven — now fifty-eight —
students; there were more than seven hundred people
in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids
here had grown up together — their grandparents had
10 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
been toddlers together. I would be the new girl from
the big city, a curiosity, a freak. Maybe, if I looked like
a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to my
advantage. But physically, I'd never fit in anywhere. I
should be tan, sporty, blond — a volleyball player, or
a cheerleader, perhaps — all the things that go with
living in the valley of the sun.
Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse
of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant
sunshine. I had always been slender, but soft
somehow, obviously not an athlete; I didn't have the
necessary hand-eye coordination to play sports
without humiliating myself — and harming both
myself and anyone else who stood too close.
When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine
dresser, I took my bag of bathroom necessities and
went to the communal bathroom to clean myself up
after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the
mirror as I brushed through my tangled, damp hair.
Maybe it was the light, but already I looked sallower,
unhealthy. My skin could be pretty — it was very
clear, almost translucent-looking — but it all
depended on color. I had no color here.
Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced
to admit that I was lying to myself. It wasn't just
physically that I'd never fit in. And if I couldn't find a
niche in a school with three thousand people, what
were my chances here?
I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth
was that I didn't relate well to people, period. Even my
mother, who I was closer to than anyone else on the
11 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
planet, was never in harmony with me, never on
exactly the same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was
seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest
of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there
was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didn't matter.
All that mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would
be just the beginning. I didn't sleep well that night,
even after I was done crying. The constant whooshing
of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fade into
the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my
head, and later added the pillow, too. But I couldn't
fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally
settled into a quieter drizzle.
Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the
morning, and I could feel the claustrophobia creeping
up on me. You could never see the sky here; it was
like a cage.
Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He wished
me good luck at school. I thanked him, knowing his
hope was wasted. Good luck tended to avoid me.
Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his
wife and family. After he left, I sat at the old square
oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and
examined his small kitchen, with its dark paneled
walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum
floor. Nothing was changed. My mother had painted
the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring
some sunshine into the house. Over the small
fireplace in the adjoining handkerchief-sized family
room was a row of pictures. First a wedding picture of
Charlie and my mom in Las Vegas, then one of the
three of us in the hospital after I was born, taken by a
12 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
helpful nurse, followed by the procession of my school
pictures up to last year's. Those were embarrassing to
look at — I would have to see what I could do to get
Charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while I
was living here.
It was impossible, being in this house, not to realize
that Charlie had never gotten over my mom. It made
me uncomfortable.
I didn't want to be too early to school, but I couldn't
stay in the house anymore. I donned my jacket —
which had the feel of a biohazard suit — and headed
out into the rain.
It was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me
through immediately as I reached for the house key
that was always hidden under the eaves by the door,
and locked up. The sloshing of my new waterproof
boots was unnerving. I missed the normal crunch of
gravel as I walked. I couldn't pause and admire my
truck again as I wanted; I was in a hurry to get out of
the misty wet that swirled around my head and clung
to my hair under my hood.
Inside the truck, it was nice and dry. Either Billy or
Charlie had obviously cleaned it up, but the tan
upholstered seats still smelled faintly of tobacco,
gasoline, and peppermint. The engine started quickly,
to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling
at top volume. Well, a truck this old was bound to
have a flaw. The antique radio worked, a plus that I
hadn't expected.
Finding the school wasn't difficult, though I'd never
been there before. The school was, like most other
13 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
things, just off the highway. It was not obvious that it
was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be
the Forks High School, made me stop. It looked like a
collection of matching houses, built with marooncolored bricks. There were so many trees and shrubs
I couldn't see its size at first. Where was the feel of
the institution? I wondered nostalgically. Where were
the chain-link fences, the metal detectors?
I parked in front of the first building, which had a
small sign over the door reading front office. No one
else was parked there, so I was sure it was off limits,
but I decided I would get directions inside instead of
circling around in the rain like an idiot. I stepped
unwillingly out of the toasty truck cab and walked
down a little stone path lined with dark hedges. I took
a deep breath before opening the door.
Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than I'd hoped.
The office was small; a little waiting area with padded
folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet,
notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big clock
ticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic
pots, as if there wasn't enough greenery outside. The
room was cut in half by a long counter, cluttered with
wire baskets full of papers and brightly colored flyers
taped to its front. There were three desks behind the
counter, one of which was manned by a large, redhaired woman wearing glasses. She was wearing a
purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel
overdressed. The red-haired woman looked up. "Can I
help you?"
"I'm Isabella Swan," I informed her, and saw the
immediate awareness light her eyes. I was expected, a
14 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
topic of gossip no doubt. Daughter of the Chief's
flighty ex-wife, come home at last.
"Of course," she said. She dug through a precariously
stacked pile of documents on her desk till she found
the ones she was looking for. "I have your schedule
right here, and a map of the school." She brought
several sheets to the counter to show roe.
She went through my classes for me, highlighting the
best route to each on the map, and gave me a slip to
have each teacher sign, which I was to bring back at
the end of the day. She smiled at me and hoped, like
Charlie, that I would like it here in Forks. I smiled
back as convincingly as I could.
When I went back out to my truck, other students
were starting to arrive. I drove around the school,
following the line of traffic. I was glad to see that most
of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. At
home I'd lived in one of the few lower-income
neighborhoods that were included in the Paradise
Valley District. It was a common thing to see a new
Mercedes or Porsche in the student lot. The nicest car
here was a shiny Volvo, and it stood out. Still, I cut
the engine as soon as I was in a spot, so that the
thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me. I
looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it
now; hopefully I wouldn't have to walk around with it
stuck in front of my nose all day. I stuffed everything
in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, and
sucked in a huge breath. I can do this, I lied to myself
feebly. No one was going to bite me. I finally exhaled
and stepped out of the truck. I kept my face pulled
back into my hood as I walked to the sidewalk,
15 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
crowded with teenagers. My plain black jacket didn't
stand out, I noticed with relief.
Once I got around the cafeteria, building three was
easy to spot. A large black "3" was painted on a white
square on the east corner. I felt my breathing
gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as I
approached the door. I tried holding my breath as I
followed two unisex raincoats through the door.
The classroom was small. The people in front of me
stopped just inside the door to hang up their coats on
a long row of hooks. I copied them. They were two
girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other also
pale, with light brown hair. At least my skin wouldn't
be a standout here. I took the slip up to the teacher, a
tall, balding man whose desk had a nameplate
identifying him as Mr. Mason. He gawked at me when
he saw my name — not an encouraging response —
and of course I flushed tomato red. But at least he
sent me to an empty desk at the back without
introducing me to the class. It was harder for my new
classmates to stare at me in the back, but somehow,
they managed. I kept my eyes down on the reading
list the teacher had given me. It was fairly basic:
Bronte, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Faulkner. I'd already
read everything. That was comforting… and boring. I
wondered if my mom would send me my folder of old
essays, or if she would think that was cheating. I
went through different arguments with her in my
head while the teacher droned on.
When the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly
boy with skin problems and hair black as an oil slick
leaned across the aisle to talk to me.
16 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?" He looked like the
overly helpful, chess club type.
"Bella," I corrected. Everyone within a three-seat
radius turned to look at me.
"Where's your next class?" he asked.
I had to check in my bag. "Um, Government, with
Jefferson, in building six."
There was nowhere to look without meeting curious
eyes.
"I'm headed toward building four, I could show you
the way…" Definitely over-helpful. "I'm Eric," he
added.
I smiled tentatively. "Thanks."
We got our jackets and headed out into the rain,
which had picked up. I could have sworn several
people behind us were walking close enough to
eavesdrop. I hoped I wasn't getting paranoid.
"So, this is a lot different than Phoenix, huh?" he
asked.
"Very."
"It doesn't rain much there, does it?"
"Three or four times a year."
"Wow, what must that be like?" he wondered.
"Sunny," I told him.
"You don't look very tan."
17 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"My mother is part albino."
He studied my face apprehensively, and I sighed. It
looked like clouds and a sense of humor didn't mix. A
few months of this and I'd forget how to use sarcasm.
We walked back around the cafeteria, to the south
buildings by the gym. Eric walked me right to the
door, though it was clearly marked.
"Well, good luck," he said as I touched the handle.
"Maybe we'll have some other classes together." He
sounded hopeful.
I smiled at him vaguely and went inside.
The rest of the morning passed in about the same
fashion. My Trigonometry teacher, Mr. Varner, who I
would have hated anyway just because of the subject
he taught, was the only one who made me stand in
front of the class and introduce myself. I stammered,
blushed, and tripped over my own boots on the way
to my seat.
After two classes, I started to recognize several of the
faces in each class. There was always someone braver
than the others who would introduce themselves and
ask me questions about how I was liking Forks. I tried
to be diplomatic, but mostly I just lied a lot. At least I
never needed the map.
One girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and
she walked with me to the cafeteria for lunch. She
was tiny, several inches shorter than my five feet four
inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot of
the difference between our heights. I couldn't
18 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
remember her name, so I smiled and nodded as she
prattled about teachers and classes. I didn't try to
keep up.
We sat at the end of a full table with several of her
friends, who she introduced to me. I forgot all their
names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed
impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy
from English, Eric, waved at me from across the
room.
It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make
conversation with seven curious strangers, that I first
saw them.
They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far
away from where I sat as possible in the long room.
There were five of them. They weren't talking, and
they weren't eating, though they each had a tray of
untouched food in front of them. They weren't
gawking at me, unlike most of the other students, so
it was safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an
excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of
these things that caught, and held, my attention.
They didn't look anything alike. Of the three boys, one
was big — muscled like a serious weight lifter, with
dark, curly hair. Another was taller, leaner, but still
muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky, less
bulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He was more
boyish than the others, who looked like they could be
in college, or even teachers here rather than students.
The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque.
She had a beautiful figure, the kind you saw on the
cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, the
19 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
kind that made every girl around her take a hit on her
self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair
was golden, gently waving to the middle of her back.
The short girl was pixielike, thin in the extreme, with
small features. Her hair was a deep black, cropped
short and pointing in every direction.
And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them
was chalky pale, the palest of all the students living
in this sunless town. Paler than me, the albino. They
all had very dark eyes despite the range in hair tones.
They also had dark shadows under those eyes —
purplish, bruiselike shadows. As if they were all
suffering from a sleepless night, or almost done
recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses,
all their features, were straight, perfect, angular.
But all this is not why I couldn't look away.
I stared because their faces, so different, so similar,
were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They
were faces you never expected to see except perhaps
on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Or
painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It
was hard to decide who was the most beautiful —
maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired
boy.
They were all looking away — away from each other,
away from the other students, away from anything in
particular as far as I could tell. As I watched, the
small girl rose with her tray — unopened soda,
unbitten apple — and walked away with a quick,
graceful lope that belonged on a runway. I watched,
amazed at her lithe dancer's step, till she dumped her
20 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
tray and glided through the back door, faster than I
would have thought possible. My eyes darted back to
the others, who sat unchanging.
"Who are they?" I asked the girl from my Spanish
class, whose name I'd forgotten.
As she looked up to see who I meant — though
already knowing, probably, from my tone — suddenly
he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyish one, the
youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for just
a fraction of a second, and then his dark eyes
flickered to mine.
He looked away quickly, more quickly than I could,
though in a flush of embarrassment I dropped my
eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance, his face
held nothing of interest — it was as if she had called
his name, and he'd looked up in involuntary
response, already having decided not to answer.
My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the
table like I did.
"That's Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and
Jasper Hale. The one who left was Alice Cullen; they
all live together with Dr. Cullen and his wife." She
said this under her breath.
I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was
looking at his tray now, picking a bagel to pieces with
long, pale fingers. His mouth was moving very
quickly, his perfect lips barely opening. The other
three still looked away, and yet I felt he was speaking
quietly to them. Strange, unpopular names, I
thought. The kinds of names grandparents had. But
21 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
maybe that was in vogue here — small town names? I
finally remembered that my neighbor was called
Jessica, a perfectly common name. There were two
girls named Jessica in my History class back home.
"They are… very nice-looking." I struggled with the
conspicuous understatement.
"Yes!" Jessica agreed with another giggle. "They're all
together though — Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper
and Alice, I mean. And they live together." Her voice
held all the shock and condemnation of the small
town, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I
had to admit that even in Phoenix, it would cause
gossip.
"Which ones are the Cullens?" I asked. "They don't
look related…"
"Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his
twenties or early thirties. They're all adopted. The
Hales are brother and sister, twins — the blondes —
and they're foster children."
"They look a little old for foster children."
"They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen,
but they've been with Mrs. Cullen since they were
eight. She's their aunt or something like that."
"That's really kind of nice — for them to take care of
all those kids like that, when they're so young and
everything."
"I guess so," Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got
the impression that she didn't like the doctor and his
wife for some reason. With the glances she was
22 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
throwing at their adopted children, I would presume
the reason was jealousy. "I think that Mrs. Cullen
can't have any kids, though," she added, as if that
lessened their kindness.
Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered
again and again to the table where the strange family
sat. They continued to look at the walls and not eat.
"Have they always lived in Forks?" I asked. Surely I
would have noticed them on one of my summers here.
"No," she said in a voice that implied it should be
obvious, even to a new arrival like me. "They just
moved down two years ago from somewhere in
Alaska."
I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as
beautiful as they were, they were outsiders, clearly
not accepted. Relief that I wasn't the only newcomer
here, and certainly not the most interesting by any
standard.
As I examined them, the youngest, one of the Cullens,
looked up and met my gaze, this time with evident
curiosity in his expression. As I looked swiftly away, it
seemed to me that his glance held some kind of
unmet expectation.
"Which one is the boy with the reddish brown hair?" I
asked. I peeked at him from the corner of my eye, and
he was still staring at me, but not gawking like the
other students had today — he had a slightly
frustrated expression. I looked down again.
23 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"That's Edward. He's gorgeous, of course, but don't
waste your time. He doesn't date. Apparently none of
the girls here are good-looking enough for him." She
sniffed, a clear case of sour grapes. I wondered when
he'd turned her down.
I bit my lip to hide my smile. Then I glanced at him
again. His face was turned away, but I thought his
cheek appeared lifted, as if he were smiling, too.
After a few more minutes, the four of them left the
table together. They all were noticeably graceful —
even the big, brawny one. It was unsettling to watch.
The one named Edward didn't look at me again. I sat
at the table with Jessica and her friends longer than I
would have if I'd been sitting alone. I was anxious not
to be late for class on my first day. One of my new
acquaintances, who considerately reminded me that
her name was Angela, had Biology II with me the next
hour. We walked to class together in silence. She was
shy, too.
When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at
a black-topped lab table exactly like the ones I was
used to. She already had a neighbor. In fact, all the
tables were filled but one. Next to the center aisle, I
recognized Edward Cullen by his unusual hair, sitting
next to that single open seat.
As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the
teacher and get my slip signed, I was watching him
surreptitiously. Just as I passed, he suddenly went
rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my
eyes with the strangest expression on his face — it
was hostile, furious. I looked away quickly, shocked,
24 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
going red again. I stumbled over a book in the
walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a
table. The girl sitting there giggled.
I'd noticed that his eyes were black — coal black.
Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book
with no nonsense about introductions. I could tell we
were going to get along. Of course, he had no choice
but to send me to the one open seat in the middle of
the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him,
bewildered by the antagonistic stare he'd given me.
I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took
my seat, but I saw his posture change from the corner
of my eye. He was leaning away from me, sitting on
the extreme edge of his chair and averting his face
like he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I
sniffed my hair. It smelled like strawberries, the scent
of my favorite shampoo. It seemed an innocent
enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right shoulder,
making a dark curtain between us, and tried to pay
attention to the teacher. Unfortunately the lecture
was on cellular anatomy, something I'd already
studied. I took notes carefully anyway, always looking
down. I couldn't stop myself from peeking
occasionally through the screen of my hair at the
strange boy next to me. During the whole class, he
never relaxed his stiff position on the edge of his
chair, sitting as far from me as possible. I could see
his hand on his left leg was clenched into a fist,
tendons standing out under his pale skin. This, too,
he never relaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white
shirt pushed up to his elbows, and his forearm was
surprisingly hard and muscular beneath his light
25 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
skin. He wasn't nearly as slight as he'd looked next to
his burly brother.
The class seemed to drag on longer than the others.
Was it because the day was finally coming to a close,
or because I was waiting for his tight fist to loosen? It
never did; he continued to sit so still it looked like he
wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him? Was
this his normal behavior? I questioned my judgment
on Jessica's bitterness at lunch today. Maybe she was
not as resentful as I'd thought.
It couldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't
know me from Eve. I peeked up at him one more time,
and regretted it. He was glaring down at me again, his
black eyes full of revulsion. As I flinched away from
him, shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks
could kill suddenly ran through my mind.
At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me
jump, and Edward Cullen was out of his seat. Fluidly
he rose — he was much taller than I'd thought — his
back to me, and he was out the door before anyone
else was out of their seat.
I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him. He
was so mean. It wasn't fair. I began gathering up my
things slowly, trying to block the anger that filled me,
for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason, my
temper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually
cried when I was angry, a humiliating tendency.
"Aren't you Isabella Swan?" a male voice asked. I
looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his pale
blond hair carefully gelled into orderly spikes, smiling
26 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
at me in a friendly way. He obviously didn't think I
smelled bad.
"Bella," I corrected him, with a smile.
"I'm Mike."
"Hi, Mike."
"Do you need any help finding your next class?"
"I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it."
"That's my next class, too." He seemed thrilled,
though it wasn't that big of a coincidence in a school
this small.
We walked to class together; he was a chatterer — he
supplied most of the conversation, which made it easy
for me. He'd lived in California till he was ten, so he
knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he was in
my English class also. He was the nicest person I'd
met today. But as we were entering the gym, he
asked, "So, did you stab Edward Cullen with a pencil
or what? I've never seen him act like that." I cringed.
So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And,
apparently, that wasn't Edward Cullen's usual
behavior. I decided to play dumb.
"Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology?" I asked
artlessly.
"Yes," he said. "He looked like he was in pain or
something."
"I don't know," I responded. "I never spoke to him."
27 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"He's a weird guy." Mike lingered by me instead of
heading to the dressing room. "If I were lucky enough
to sit by you, I would have talked to you."
I smiled at him before walking through the girls'
locker room door. He was friendly and clearly
admiring. But it wasn't enough to ease my irritation.
The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform
but didn't make me dress down for today's class. At
home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P.E.
was mandatory all four years. Forks was literally my
personal hell on Earth.
I watched four volleyball games running
simultaneously. Remembering how many injuries I
had sustained — and inflicted — playing volleyball, I
felt faintly nauseated.
The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office
to return my paperwork. The rain had drifted away,
but the wind was strong, and colder. I wrapped my
arms around myself.
When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned
around and walked back out.
Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I
recognized again that tousled bronze hair. He didn't
appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood
pressed against the back wall, waiting for the
receptionist to be free.
He was arguing with her in a low, attractive voice. I
quickly picked up the gist of the argument. He was
28 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
trying to trade from sixth-hour Biology to another
time — any other time.
I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had
to be something else, something that happened before
I entered the Biology room. The look on his face must
have been about another aggravation entirely. It was
impossible that this stranger could take such a
sudden, intense dislike to me.
The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly
gusted through the room, rustling the papers on the
desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who
came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in
the wire basket, and walked out again. But Edward
Cullen's back stiffened, and he turned slowly to glare
at me — his face was absurdly handsome — with
piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill
of genuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look
only lasted a second, but it chilled me more than the
freezing wind. He turned back to the receptionist.
"Never mind, then," he said hastily in a voice like
velvet. "I can see that it's impossible. Thank you so
much for your help." And he turned on his heel
without another look at me, and disappeared out the
door. I went meekly to the desk, my face white for
once instead of red, and handed her the signed slip.
"How did your first day go, dear?" the receptionist
asked maternally.
"Fine," I lied, my voice weak. She didn't look
convinced. When I got to the truck, it was almost the
last car in the lot. It seemed like a haven, already the
closest thing to home I had in this damp green hole. I
29 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield
blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the
heater, so I turned the key and the engine roared to
life. I headed back to Charlie's house, fighting tears
the whole way there.

OPEN BOOK
The next day was better… and worse.
It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the
clouds were dense and opaque. It was easier because
I knew what to expect of my day. Mike came to sit by
me in English, and walked me to my next class, with
Chess Club Eric glaring at him all the while; that was
nattering. People didn't look at me quite as much as
they had yesterday. I sat with a big group at lunch
that included Mike, Eric, Jessica, and several other
people whose names and faces I now remembered. I
began to feel like I was treading water, instead of
drowning in it.
It was worse because I was tired; I still couldn't sleep
with the wind echoing around the house. It was worse
because Mr. Varner called on me in Trig when my
hand wasn't raised and I had the wrong answer. It
was miserable because I had to play volleyball, and
the one time I didn't cringe out of the way of the ball,
I hit my teammate in the head with it. And it was
worse because Edward Cullen wasn't in school at all.
All morning I was dreading lunch, fearing his bizarre
glares. Part of me wanted to confront him and
demand to know what his problem was. While I was
lying sleepless in my bed, I even imagined what I
would say. But I knew myself too well to think I would
really have the guts to do it. I made the Cowardly Lion
look like the terminator.
31 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
But when I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica —
trying to keep my eyes from sweeping the place for
him, and failing entirely — I saw that his four siblings
of sorts were sitting together at the same table, and
he was not with them.
Mike intercepted us and steered us to his table.
Jessica seemed elated by the attention, and her
friends quickly joined us. But as I tried to listen to
their easy chatter, I was terribly uncomfortable,
waiting nervously for the moment he would arrive. I
hoped that he would simply ignore me when he came,
and prove my suspicions false.
He didn't come, and as time passed I grew more and
more tense. I walked to Biology with more confidence
when, by the end of lunch, he still hadn't showed.
Mike, who was taking on the qualities of a golden
retriever, walked faithfully by my side to class. I held
my breath at the door, but Edward Cullen wasn't
there, either. I exhaled and went to my seat. Mike
followed, talking about an upcoming trip to the beach.
He lingered by my desk till the bell rang. Then he
smiled at me wistfully and went to sit by a girl with
braces and a bad perm. It looked like I was going to
have to do something about Mike, and it wouldn't be
easy. In a town like this, where everyone lived on top
of everyone else, diplomacy was essential. I had never
been enormously tactful; I had no practice dealing
with overly friendly boys.
I was relieved that I had the desk to myself, that
Edward was absent. I told myself that repeatedly. But
I couldn't get rid of the nagging suspicion that I was
the reason he wasn't there. It was ridiculous, and
32 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
egotistical, to think that I could affect anyone that
strongly. It was impossible. And yet I couldn't stop
worrying that it was true. When the school day was
finally done, and the blush was fading out of my
cheeks from the volleyball incident, I changed quickly
back into my jeans and navy blue sweater. I hurried
from the girls' locker room, pleased to find that I had
successfully evaded my retriever friend for the
moment. I walked swiftly out to the parking lot. It was
crowded now with fleeing students. I got in my truck
and dug through my bag to make sure I had what I
needed.
Last night I'd discovered that Charlie couldn't cook
much besides fried eggs and bacon. So I requested
that I be assigned kitchen detail for the duration of
my stay. He was willing enough to hand over the keys
to the banquet hall. I also found out that he had no
food in the house. So I had my shopping list and the
cash from the jar in the cupboard labeled FOOD
MONEY, and I was on my way to the Thriftway.
I gunned my deafening engine to life, ignoring the
heads that turned in my direction, and backed
carefully into a place in the line of cars that were
waiting to exit the parking lot. As I waited, trying to
pretend that the earsplitting rumble was coming from
someone else's car, I saw the two Cullens and the
Hale twins getting into their car. It was the shiny new
Volvo. Of course. I hadn't noticed their clothes before
— I'd been too mesmerized by their faces. Now that I
looked, it was obvious that they were all dressed
exceptionally well; simply, but in clothes that subtly
hinted at designer origins. With their remarkable good
33 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
looks, the style with which they carried themselves,
they could have worn dishrags and pulled it off. It
seemed excessive for them to have both looks and
money. But as far as I could tell, life worked that way
most of the time. It didn't look as if it bought them
any acceptance here.
No, I didn't fully believe that. The isolation must be
their desire; I couldn't imagine any door that wouldn't
be opened by that degree of beauty.
They looked at my noisy truck as I passed them, just
like everyone else. I kept my eyes straight forward and
was relieved when I finally was free of the school
grounds.
The Thriftway was not far from the school, just a few
streets south, off the highway. It was nice to be inside
the supermarket; it felt normal. I did the shopping at
home, and I fell into the pattern of the familiar task
gladly. The store was big enough inside that I couldn't
hear the tapping of the rain on the roof to remind me
where I was. When I got home, I unloaded all the
groceries, stuffing them in wherever I could find an
open space. I hoped Charlie wouldn't mind. I wrapped
potatoes in foil and stuck them in the oven to bake,
covered a steak in marinade and balanced it on top of
a carton of eggs in the fridge. When I was finished
with that, I took my book bag upstairs. Before
starting my homework, I changed into a pair of dry
sweats, pulled my damp hair up into a pony-tail, and
checked my e-mail for the first time. I had three
messages.
"Bella," my mom wrote…
34 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
Write me as soon as you get in. Tell me how your
flight was. Is it raining? I miss you already. I'm almost
finished packing for Florida, but I can't find my pink
blouse. Do you know where I put it? Phil says hi.
Mom.
I sighed and went to the next. It was sent eight hours
after the first.
"Bella," she wrote…
Why haven't you e-mailed me yet? What are you
waiting for? Mom. The last was from this morning.
Isabella,
If I haven't heard from you by 5:30 p.m. today I'm
calling Charlie. I checked the clock. I still had an
hour, but my mom was well known for jumping the
gun.
Mom,
Calm down. I'm writing right now. Don't do anything
rash. Bella.
I sent that, and began again.
Mom,
Everything is great. Of course it's raining. I was
waiting for something to write about. School isn't bad,
just a little repetitive. I met some nice kids who sit by
me at lunch.
Your blouse is at the dry cleaners - you were
supposed to pick it up Friday.
35 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
Charlie bought me a truck, can you believe it? I love
it. It's old, but really sturdy, which is good, you know,
for me.
I miss you, too. I'll write again soon, but I'm not going
to check my e-mail every five minutes. Relax, breathe.
I love you.
Bella.
I had decided to read Wuthering Heights — the novel
we were currently studying in English — yet again for
the fun of it, and that's what I was doing when
Charlie came home. I'd lost track of the time, and I
hurried downstairs to take the potatoes out and put
the steak in to broil.
"Bella?" my father called out when he heard me on
the stairs. Who else? I thought to myself.
"Hey, Dad, welcome home."
"Thanks." He hung up his gun belt and stepped out of
his boots as I bustled about the kitchen. As far as I
was aware, he'd never shot the gun on the job. But he
kept it ready. When I came here as a child, he would
always remove the bullets as soon as he walked in the
door. I guess he considered me old enough now not to
shoot myself by accident, and not depressed enough
to shoot myself on purpose.
"What's for dinner?" he asked warily. My mother was
an imaginative cook, and her experiments weren't
always edible. I was surprised, and sad, that he
seemed to remember that far back.
36 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Steak and potatoes," I answered, and he looked
relieved. He seemed to feel awkward standing in the
kitchen doing nothing; he lumbered into the living
room to watch TV while I worked. We were both more
comfortable that way. I made a salad while the steaks
cooked, and set the table.
I called him in when dinner was ready, and he sniffed
appreciatively as he walked into the room.
"Smells good, Bell."
"Thanks."
We ate in silence for a few minutes. It wasn't
uncomfortable. Neither of us was bothered by the
quiet. In some ways, we were well suited for living
together.
"So, how did you like school? Have you made any
friends?" he asked as he was taking seconds.
"Well, I have a few classes with a girl named Jessica. I
sit with her friends at lunch. And there's this boy,
Mike, who's very friendly. Everybody seems pretty
nice." With one outstanding exception.
"That must be Mike Newton. Nice kid — nice family.
His dad owns the sporting goods store just outside of
town. He makes a good living off all the backpackers
who come through here."
"Do you know the Cullen family?" I asked hesitantly.
"Dr. Cullen's family? Sure. Dr. Cullen's a great man."
37 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"They… the kids… are a little different. They don't
seem to fit in very well at school."
Charlie surprised me by looking angry.
"People in this town," he muttered. "Dr. Cullen is a
brilliant surgeon who could probably work in any
hospital in the world, make ten times the salary he
gets here," he continued, getting louder. "We're lucky
to have him — lucky that his wife wanted to live in a
small town. He's an asset to the community, and all
of those kids are well behaved and polite. I had my
doubts, when they first moved in, with all those
adopted teenagers. I thought we might have some
problems with them. But they're all very mature — I
haven't had one speck of trouble from any of them.
That's more than I can say for the children of some
folks who have lived in this town for generations. And
they stick together the way a family should —
camping trips every other weekend… Just because
they're newcomers, people have to talk."
It was the longest speech I'd ever heard Charlie make.
He must feel strongly about whatever people were
saying.
I backpedaled. "They seemed nice enough to me. I
just noticed they kept to themselves. They're all very
attractive," I added, trying to be more complimentary.
"You should see the doctor," Charlie said, laughing.
"It's a good thing he's happily married. A lot of the
nurses at the hospital have a hard time concentrating
on their work with him around."
38 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
We lapsed back into silence as we finished eating. He
cleared the table while I started on the dishes. He
went back to the TV, and after I finished washing the
dishes by hand — no dishwasher — I went upstairs
unwillingly to work on my math homework. I could
feel a tradition in the making.
That night it was finally quiet. I fell asleep quickly,
exhausted. The rest of the week was uneventful. I got
used to the routine of my classes. By Friday I was
able to recognize, if not name, almost all the students
at school. In Gym, the kids on my team learned not to
pass me the ball and to step quickly in front of me if
the other team tried to take advantage of my
weakness. I happily stayed out of their way. Edward
Cullen didn't come back to school.
Every day, I watched anxiously until the rest of the
Cullens entered the cafeteria without him. Then I
could relax and join in the lunchtime conversation.
Mostly it centered around a trip to the La Push Ocean
Park in two weeks that Mike was putting together. I
was invited, and I had agreed to go, more out of
politeness than desire. Beaches should be hot and
dry.
By Friday I was perfectly comfortable entering my
Biology class, no longer worried that Edward would
be there. For all I knew, he had dropped out of school.
I tried not to think about him, but I couldn't totally
suppress the worry that I was responsible for his
continued absence, ridiculous as it seemed.
My first weekend in Forks passed without incident.
Charlie, unused to spending time in the usually
39 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
empty house, worked most of the weekend. I cleaned
the house, got ahead on my homework, and wrote my
mom more bogusly cheerful e-mail. I did drive to the
library Saturday, but it was so poorly stocked that I
didn't bother to get a card; I would have to make a
date to visit Olympia or Seattle soon and find a good
bookstore. I wondered idly what kind of gas mileage
the truck got… and shuddered at the thought.
The rain stayed soft over the weekend, quiet, so I was
able to sleep well. People greeted me in the parking lot
Monday morning. I didn't know all their names, but I
waved back and smiled at everyone. It was colder this
morning, but happily not raining. In English, Mike
took his accustomed seat by my side. We had a pop
quiz on Wuthering Heights. It was straightforward,
very easy.
All in all, I was feeling a lot more comfortable than I
had thought I would feel by this point. More
comfortable than I had ever expected to feel here.
When we walked out of class, the air was full of
swirling bits of white. I could hear people shouting
excitedly to each other. The wind bit at my cheeks,
my nose.
"Wow," Mike said. "It's snowing."
I looked at the little cotton fluffs that were building up
along the sidewalk and swirling erratically past my
face.
"Ew." Snow. There went my good day.
He looked surprised. "Don't you like snow?"
40 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"No. That means it's too cold for rain." Obviously.
"Besides, I thought it was supposed to come down in
flakes — you know, each one unique and all that.
These just look like the ends of Q-tips."
"Haven't you ever seen snow fall before?" he asked
incredulously.
"Sure I have." I paused. "On TV."
Mike laughed. And then a big, squishy ball of
dripping snow smacked into the back of his head. We
both turned to see where it came from. I had my
suspicions about Eric, who was walking away, his
back toward us — in the wrong direction for his next
class. Mike appatently had the same notion. He bent
over and began scraping together a pile of the white
mush.
"I'll see you at lunch, okay?" I kept walking as I
spoke. "Once people start throwing wet stuff, I go
inside."
He just nodded, his eyes on Eric's retreating figure.
Throughout the morning, everyone chattered excitedly
about the snow; apparently it was the first snowfall of
the new year. I kept my mouth shut. Sure, it was
drier than rain — until it melted in your socks. I
walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after
Spanish. Mush balls were flying everywhere. I kept a
binder in my hands, ready to use it as a shield if
necessary. Jessica thought I was hilarious, but
something in my expression kept her from lobbing a
snowball at me herself. Mike caught up to us as we
walked in the doors, laughing, with ice melting the
41 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
spikes in his hair. He and Jessica were talking
animatedly about the snow fight as we got in line to
buy food. I glanced toward that table in the corner out
of habit. And then I froze where I stood. There were
five people at the table.
Jessica pulled on my arm.
"Hello? Bella? What do you want?"
I looked down; my ears were hot. I had no reason to
feel self-conscious, I reminded myself. I hadn't done
anything wrong.
"What's with Bella?" Mike asked Jessica.
"Nothing," I answered. "I'll just get a soda today." I
caught up to the end of the line.
"Aren't you hungry?" Jessica asked.
"Actually, I feel a little sick," I said, my eyes still on
the floor. I waited for them to get their food, and then
followed them to a table, my eyes on my feet.
I sipped my soda slowly, my stomach churning. Twice
Mike asked, with unnecessary concern, how I was
feeling.
I told him it was nothing, but I was wondering if I
should play it up and escape to the nurse's office for
the next hour.
Ridiculous. I shouldn't have to run away.
I decided to permit myself one glance at the Cullen
family's table. If he was glaring at me, I would skip
Biology, like the coward I was. I kept my head down
42 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
and glanced up under my lashes. None of them were
looking this way. I lifted my head a little.
They were laughing. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all
had their hair entirely saturated with melting snow.
Alice and Rosalie were leaning away as Emmett shook
his dripping hair toward them. They were enjoying the
snowy day, just like everyone else — only they looked
more like a scene from a movie than the rest of us.
But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there
was something different, and I couldn't quite pinpoint
what that difference was. I examined Edward the
most carefully. His skin was less pale, I decided —
flushed from the snow fight maybe — the circles
under his eyes much less noticeable. But there was
something more. I pondered, staring, trying to isolate
the change.
"Bella, what are you staring at?" Jessica intruded, her
eyes following my stare.
At that precise moment, his eyes flashed over to meet
mine. I dropped my head, letting my hair fall to
conceal my face. I was sure, though, in the instant
our eyes met, that he didn't look harsh or unfriendly
as he had the last time I'd seen him. He looked merely
curious again, unsatisfied in some way.
"Edward Cullen is staring at you," Jessica giggled in
my ear.
"He doesn't look angry, does he?" I couldn't help
asking.
"No. That means it's too cold for rain." Obviously.
"Besides, I thought it was supposed to come down in
flakes — you know, each one unique and all that.
These just look like the ends of Q-tips."
"Haven't you ever seen snow fall before?" he asked
incredulously.
"Sure I have." I paused. "On TV."
Mike laughed. And then a big, squishy ball of
dripping snow smacked into the back of his head. We
both turned to see where it came from. I had my
suspicions about Eric, who was walking away, his
back toward us — in the wrong direction for his next
class. Mike appatently had the same notion. He bent
over and began scraping together a pile of the white
mush.
"I'll see you at lunch, okay?" I kept walking as I
spoke. "Once people start throwing wet stuff, I go
inside."
He just nodded, his eyes on Eric's retreating figure.
Throughout the morning, everyone chattered excitedly
about the snow; apparently it was the first snowfall of
the new year. I kept my mouth shut. Sure, it was
drier than rain — until it melted in your socks. I
walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after
Spanish. Mush balls were flying everywhere. I kept a
binder in my hands, ready to use it as a shield if
necessary. Jessica thought I was hilarious, but
something in my expression kept her from lobbing a
snowball at me herself. Mike caught up to us as we
walked in the doors, laughing, with ice melting the
41 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
spikes in his hair. He and Jessica were talking
animatedly about the snow fight as we got in line to
buy food. I glanced toward that table in the corner out
of habit. And then I froze where I stood. There were
five people at the table.
Jessica pulled on my arm.
"Hello? Bella? What do you want?"
I looked down; my ears were hot. I had no reason to
feel self-conscious, I reminded myself. I hadn't done
anything wrong.
"What's with Bella?" Mike asked Jessica.
"Nothing," I answered. "I'll just get a soda today." I
caught up to the end of the line.
"Aren't you hungry?" Jessica asked.
"Actually, I feel a little sick," I said, my eyes still on
the floor. I waited for them to get their food, and then
followed them to a table, my eyes on my feet.
I sipped my soda slowly, my stomach churning. Twice
Mike asked, with unnecessary concern, how I was
feeling.
I told him it was nothing, but I was wondering if I
should play it up and escape to the nurse's office for
the next hour.
Ridiculous. I shouldn't have to run away.
I decided to permit myself one glance at the Cullen
family's table. If he was glaring at me, I would skip
Biology, like the coward I was. I kept my head down
42 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
and glanced up under my lashes. None of them were
looking this way. I lifted my head a little.
They were laughing. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all
had their hair entirely saturated with melting snow.
Alice and Rosalie were leaning away as Emmett shook
his dripping hair toward them. They were enjoying the
snowy day, just like everyone else — only they looked
more like a scene from a movie than the rest of us.
But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there
was something different, and I couldn't quite pinpoint
what that difference was. I examined Edward the
most carefully. His skin was less pale, I decided —
flushed from the snow fight maybe — the circles
under his eyes much less noticeable. But there was
something more. I pondered, staring, trying to isolate
the change.
"Bella, what are you staring at?" Jessica intruded, her
eyes following my stare.
At that precise moment, his eyes flashed over to meet
mine. I dropped my head, letting my hair fall to
conceal my face. I was sure, though, in the instant
our eyes met, that he didn't look harsh or unfriendly
as he had the last time I'd seen him. He looked merely
curious again, unsatisfied in some way.
"Edward Cullen is staring at you," Jessica giggled in
my ear.
"He doesn't look angry, does he?" I couldn't help
asking.
43 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"No," she said, sounding confused by my question.
"Should he be?"
"I don't think he likes me," I confided. I still felt
queasy. I put my head down on my arm.
"The Cullens don't like anybody… well, they don't
notice anybody enough to like them. But he's still
staring at you."
"Stop looking at him," I hissed.
She snickered, but she looked away. I raised my head
enough to make sure that she did, contemplating
violence if she resisted.
Mike interrupted us then — he was planning an epic
battle of the blizzard in the parking lot after school
and wanted us to join. Jessica agreed
enthusiastically. The way she looked at Mike left little
doubt that she would be up for anything he
suggested. I kept silent. I would have to hide in the
gym until the parking lot cleared.
For the rest of the lunch hour I very carefully kept my
eyes at my own table. I decided to honor the bargain
I'd made with myself. Since he didn't look angry, I
would go to Biology. My stomach did frightened little
flips at the thought of sitting next to him again. I
didn't really want to walk to class with Mike as usual
— he seemed to be a popular target for the snowball
snipers — but when we went to the door, everyone
besides me groaned in unison. It was raining,
washing all traces of the snow away in clear, icy
ribbons down the side of the walkway. I pulled my
44 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
hood up, secretly pleased. I would be free to go
straight home after Gym.
Mike kept up a string of complaints on the way to
building four. Once inside the classroom, I saw with
relief that my table was still empty. Mr. Banner was
walking around the room, distributing one
microscope and box of slides to each table. Class
didn't start for a few minutes, and the room buzzed
with conversation. I kept my eyes away from the door,
doodling idly on the cover of my notebook.
I heard very clearly when the chair next to me moved,
but my eyes stayed carefully focused on the pattern I
was drawing.
"Hello," said a quiet, musical voice.
I looked up, stunned that he was speaking to me. He
was sitting as far away from me as the desk allowed,
but his chair was angled toward me. His hair was
dripping wet, disheveled — even so, he looked like
he'd just finished shooting a commercial for hair gel.
His dazzling face was friendly, open, a slight smile on
his flawless lips. But his eyes were careful.
"My name is Edward Cullen," he continued. "I didn't
have a chance to introduce myself last week. You
must be Bella Swan." My mind was spinning with
confusion. Had I made up the whole thing? He was
perfectly polite now. I had to speak; he was waiting.
But I couldn't think of anything conventional to say.
"H-how do you know my name?" I stammered.
He laughed a soft, enchanting laugh.
45 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Oh, I think everyone knows your name. The whole
town's been waiting for you to arrive."
I grimaced. I knew it was something like that.
"No," I persisted stupidly. "I meant, why did you call
me Bella?" He seemed confused. "Do you prefer
Isabella?"
"No, I like Bella," I said. "But I think Charlie — I mean
my dad — must call me Isabella behind my back —
that's what everyone here seems to know me as," I
tried to explain, feeling like an utter moron.
"Oh." He let it drop. I looked away awkwardly.
Thankfully, Mr. Banner started class at that moment.
I tried to concentrate as he explained the lab we
would be doing today. The slides in the box were out
of order. Working as lab partners, we had to separate
the slides of onion root tip cells into the phases of
mitosis they represented and label them accordingly.
We weren't supposed to use our books. In twenty
minutes, he would be coming around to see who had
it right.
"Get started," he commanded.
"Ladies first, partner?" Edward asked. I looked up to
see him smiling a crooked smile so beautiful that I
could only stare at him like an idiot.
"Or I could start, if you wish." The smile faded; he was
obviously wondering if I was mentally competent.
"No," I said, flushing. "I'll go ahead." I was showing
off, just a little. I'd already done this lab, and I knew
46 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
what I was looking for. It should be easy. I snapped
the first slide into place under the microscope and
adjusted it quickly to the 40X objective. I studied the
slide briefly.
My assessment was confident. "Prophase."
"Do you mind if I look?" he asked as I began to
remove the slide. His hand caught mine, to stop me,
as he asked. His fingers were ice-cold, like he'd been
holding them in a snowdrift before class. But that
wasn't why I jerked my hand away so quickly. When
he touched me, it stung my hand as if an electric
current had passed through us.
"I'm sorry," he muttered, pulling his hand back
immediately. However, he continued to reach for the
microscope. I watched him, still staggered, as he
examined the slide for an even shorter time than I
had.
"Prophase," he agreed, writing it neatly in the first
space on our worksheet. He swiftly switched out the
first slide for the second, and then glanced at it
cursorily.
"Anaphase," he murmured, writing it down as he
spoke. I kept my voice indifferent. "May I?"
He smirked and pushed the microscope to me.
I looked through the eyepiece eagerly, only to be
disappointed. Dang it, he was right.
"Slide three?" I held out my hand without looking at
him. He handed it to me; it seemed like he was being
careful not to touch my skin again.
47 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
I took the most fleeting look I could manage.
"Interphase." I passed him the microscope before he
could ask for it. He took a swift peek, and then wrote
it down. I would have written it while he looked, but
his clear, elegant script intimidated me. I didn't want
to spoil the page with my clumsy scrawl.
We were finished before anyone else was close. I could
see Mike and his partner comparing two slides again
and again, and another group had their book open
under the table.
Which left me with nothing to do but try to not look at
him…
unsuccessfully. I glanced up, and he was staring at
me, that same inexplicable look of frustration in his
eyes. Suddenly I identified that subtle difference in
his face.
"Did you get contacts?" I blurted out unthinkingly. He
seemed puzzled by my unexpected question. "No."
"Oh," I mumbled. "I thought there was something
different about your eyes."
He shrugged, and looked away.
In fact, I was sure there was something different. I
vividly remembered the flat black color of his eyes the
last time he'd glared at me — the color was striking
against the background of his pale skin and his
auburn hair. Today, his eyes were a completely
different color: a strange ocher, darker than
butterscotch, but with the same golden tone. I didn't
understand how that could be, unless he was lying
48 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
for some reason about the contacts. Or maybe Forks
was making me crazy in the literal sense of the word.
I looked down. His hands were clenched into hard
fists again. Mr. Banner came to our table then, to see
why we weren't working. He looked over our
shoulders to glance at the completed lab, and then
stared more intently to check the answers.
"So, Edward, didn't you think Isabella should get a
chance with the microscope?" Mr. Banner asked.
"Bella," Edward corrected automatically. "Actually,
she identified three of the five."
Mr. Banner looked at me now; his expression was
skeptical.
"Have you done this lab before?" he asked.
I smiled sheepishly. "Not with onion root."
"Whitefish blastula?"
"Yeah."
Mr. Banner nodded. "Were you in an advanced
placement program in Phoenix?"
"Yes."
"Well," he said after a moment, "I guess it's good you
two are lab partners." He mumbled something else as
he walked away. After he left, I began doodling on my
notebook again.
"It's too bad about the snow, isn't it?" Edward asked. I
had the feeling that he was forcing himself to make
49 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
small talk with me. Paranoia swept over me again. It
was like he had heard my conversation with Jessica
at lunch and was trying to prove me wrong.
"Not really," I answered honestly, instead of
pretending to be normal like everyone else. I was still
trying to dislodge the stupid feeling of suspicion, and
I couldn't concentrate.
"You don't like the cold." It wasn't a question.
"Or the wet."
"Forks must be a difficult place for you to live," he
mused.
"You have no idea," I muttered darkly.
He looked fascinated by what I said, for some reason I
couldn't imagine. His face was such a distraction that
I tried not to look at it any more than courtesy
absolutely demanded.
"Why did you come here, then?"
No one had asked me that — not straight out like he
did, demanding.
"It's… complicated."
"I think I can keep up," he pressed.
I paused for a long moment, and then made the
mistake of meeting his gaze. His dark gold eyes
confused me, and I answered without thinking.
"My mother got remarried," I said.
50 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"That doesn't sound so complex," he disagreed, but he
was suddenly sympathetic. "When did that happen?"
"Last September." My voice sounded sad, even to me.
"And you don't like him," Edward surmised, his tone
still kind.
"No, Phil is fine. Too young, maybe, but nice enough."
"Why didn't you stay with them?"
I couldn't fathom his interest, but he continued to
stare at me with penetrating eyes, as if my dull life's
story was somehow vitally important.
"Phil travels a lot. He plays ball for a living." I halfsmiled.
"Have I heard of him?" he asked, smiling in response.
"Probably not. He doesn't play well. Strictly minor
league. He moves around a lot."
"And your mother sent you here so that she could
travel with him." He said it as an assumption again,
not a question.
My chin raised a fraction. "No, she did not send me
here. I sent myself." His eyebrows knit together. "I
don't understand," he admitted, and he seemed
unnecessarily frustrated by that fact.
I sighed. Why was I explaining this to him? He
continued to stare at me with obvious curiosity.
"She stayed with me at first, but she missed him. It
made her unhappy… so I decided it was time to spend
51 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
some quality time with Charlie." My voice was glum
by the time I finished.
"But now you're unhappy," he pointed out.
"And?" I challenged.
"That doesn't seem fair." He shrugged, but his eyes
were still intense. I laughed without humor. "Hasn't
anyone ever told you? Life isn't fair."
"I believe I have heard that somewhere before," he
agreed dryly.
"So that's all," I insisted, wondering why he was still
staring at me that way.
His gaze became appraising. "You put on a good
show," he said slowly.
"But I'd be willing to bet that you're suffering more
than you let anyone see."
I grimaced at him, resisting the impulse to stick out
my tongue like a five-year-old, and looked away.
"Am I wrong?"
I tried to ignore him.
"I didn't think so," he murmured smugly.
"Why does it matter to you?" I asked, irritated. I kept
my eyes away, watching the teacher make his rounds.
"That's a very good question," he muttered, so quietly
that I wondered if he was talking to himself. However,
after a few seconds of silence, I decided that was the
only answer I was going to get.
52 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
I sighed, scowling at the blackboard.
"Am I annoying you?" he asked. He sounded amused.
I glanced at him without thinking… and told the truth
again. "Not exactly. I'm more annoyed at myself. My
face is so easy to read — my mother always calls me
her open book." I frowned.
"On the contrary, I find you very difficult to read."
Despite everything that I'd said and he'd guessed, he
sounded like he meant it.
"You must be a good reader then," I replied.
"Usually." He smiled widely, flashing a set of perfect,
ultrawhite teeth. Mr. Banner called the class to order
then, and I turned with relief to listen. I was in
disbelief that I'd just explained my dreary life to this
bizarre, beautiful boy who may or may not despise
me. He'd seemed engrossed in our conversation, but
now I could see, from the corner of my eye, that he
was leaning away from me again, his hands gripping
the edge of the table with unmistakable tension.
I tried to appear attentive as Mr. Banner illustrated,
with transparencies on the overhead projector, what I
had seen without difficulty through the microscope.
But my thoughts were unmanageable. When the bell
finally rang, Edward rushed as swiftly and as
gracefully from the room as he had last Monday. And,
like last Monday, I stared after him in amazement.
Mike skipped quickly to my side and picked up my
books for me. I imagined him with a wagging tail.
53 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"That was awful," he groaned. "They all looked exactly
the same. You're lucky you had Cullen for a partner."
"I didn't have any trouble with it," I said, stung by his
assumption. I regretted the snub instantly. "I've done
the lab before, though," I added before he could get
his feelings hurt.
"Cullen seemed friendly enough today," he
commented as we shrugged into our raincoats. He
didn't seem pleased about it.
I tried to sound indifferent. "I wonder what was with
him last Monday." I couldn't concentrate on Mike's
chatter as we walked to Gym, and RE. didn't do much
to hold my attention, either. Mike was on my team
today. He chivalrously covered my position as well as
his own, so my woolgathering was only interrupted
when it was my turn to serve; my team ducked warily
out of the way every time I was up.
The rain was just a mist as I walked to the parking
lot, but I was happier when I was in the dry cab. I got
the heater running, for once not caring about the
mind-numbing roar of the engine. I unzipped my
jacket, put the hood down, and fluffed my damp hair
out so the heater could dry it on the way home.
I looked around me to make sure it was clear. That's
when I noticed the still, white figure. Edward Cullen
was leaning against the front door of the Volvo, three
cars down from me, and staring intently in my
direction. I swiftly looked away and threw the truck
into reverse, almost hitting a rusty Toyota Corolla in
my haste. Lucky for the Toyota, I stomped on the
brake in time. It was just the sort of car that my truck
54 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
would make scrap metal of. I took a deep breath, still
looking out the other side of my car, and cautiously
pulled out again, with greater success. I stared
straight ahead as I passed the Volvo, but from a
peripheral peek, I would swear I saw him laughing.
55 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
PHENOMENON
When I opened my eyes in the morning, something
was different. It was the light. It was still the graygreen light of a cloudy day in the forest, but it was
clearer somehow. I realized there was no fog veiling
my window.
I jumped up to look outside, and then groaned in
horror.
A fine layer of snow covered the yard, dusted the top
of my truck, and whitened the road. But that wasn't
the worst part. All the rain from yesterday had frozen
solid — coating the needles on the trees in fantastic,
gorgeous patterns, and making the driveway a deadly
ice slick. I had enough trouble not falling down when
the ground was dry; it might be safer for me to go
back to bed now.
Charlie had left for work before I got downstairs. In a
lot of ways, living with Charlie was like having my
own place, and I found myself reveling in the
aloneness instead of being lonely.
I threw down a quick bowl of cereal and some orange
juice from the carton. I felt excited to go to school,
and that scared me. I knew it wasn't the stimulating
learning environment I was anticipating, or seeing my
new set of friends. If I was being honest with myself, I
knew I was eager to get to school because I would see
Edward Cullen. And that was very, very stupid.
56 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
I should be avoiding him entirely after my brainless
and embarrassing babbling yesterday. And I was
suspicious of him; why should he lie about his eyes? I
was still frightened of the hostility I sometimes felt
emanating from him, and I was still tongue-tied
whenever I pictured his perfect face. I was well aware
that my league and his league were spheres that did
not touch. So I shouldn't be at all anxious to see him
today. It took every ounce of my concentration to
make it down the icy brick driveway alive. I almost
lost my balance when I finally got to the truck, but I
managed to cling to the side mirror and save myself.
Clearly, today was going to be nightmarish.
Driving to school, I distracted myself from my fear of
falling and my unwanted speculations about Edward
Cullen by thinking about Mike and Eric, and the
obvious difference in how teenage boys responded to
me here. I was sure I looked exactly the same as I had
in Phoenix. Maybe it was just that the boys back
home had watched me pass slowly through all the
awkward phases of adolescence and still thought of
me that way. Perhaps it was because I was a novelty
here, where novelties were few and far between.
Possibly my crippling clumsiness was seen as
endearing rather than pathetic, casting me as a
damsel in distress. Whatever the reason, Mike's
puppy dog behavior and Eric's apparent rivalry with
him were disconcerting. I wasn't sure if I didn't prefer
being ignored. My truck seemed to have no problem
with the black ice that covered the roads. I drove very
slowly, though, not wanting to carve a path of
destruction through Main Street.
57 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
When I got out of my truck at school, I saw why I'd
had so little trouble. Something silver caught my eye,
and I walked to the back of the truck — carefully
holding the side for support — to examine my tires.
There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond
shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who
knows how early to put snow chains on my truck. My
throat suddenly felt tight. I wasn't used to being
taken care of, and Charlie's unspoken concern caught
me by surprise.
I was standing by the back corner of the truck,
struggling to fight back the sudden wave of emotion
the snow chains had brought on, when I heard an
odd sound.
It was a high-pitched screech, and it was fast
becoming painfully loud. I looked up, startled.
I saw several things simultaneously. Nothing was
moving in slow motion, the way it does in the movies.
Instead, the adrenaline rush seemed to make my
brain work much faster, and I was able to absorb in
clear detail several things at once.
Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me,
staring at me in horror. His face stood out from a sea
of faces, all frozen in the same mask of shock. But of
more immediate importance was the dark blue van
that was skidding, tires locked and squealing against
the brakes, spinning wildly across the ice of the
parking lot. It was going to hit the back corner of my
truck, and I was standing between them. I didn't even
have time to close my eyes.
58 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
Just before I heard the shattering crunch of the van
folding around the truck bed, something hit me, hard,
but not from the direction I was expecting. My head
cracked against the icy blacktop, and I felt something
solid and cold pinning me to the ground. I was lying
on the pavement behind the tan car I'd parked next
to. But I didn't have a chance to notice anything else,
because the van was still coming. It had curled
gratingly around the end of the truck and, still
spinning and sliding, was about to collide with me
again.
A low oath made me aware that someone was with
me, and the voice was impossible not to recognize.
Two long, white hands shot out protectively in front of
me, and the van shuddered to a stop a foot from my
face, the large hands fitting providentially into a deep
dent in the side of the van's body.
Then his hands moved so fast they blurred. One was
suddenly gripping under the body of the van, and
something was dragging me, swinging my legs around
like a rag doll's, till they hit the tire of the tan car. A
groaning metallic thud hurt my ears, and the van
settled, glass popping, onto the asphalt — exactly
where, a second ago, my legs had been. It was
absolutely silent for one long second before the
screaming began. In the abrupt bedlam, I could hear
more than one person shouting my name. But more
clearly than all the yelling, I could hear Edward
Cullen's low, frantic voice in my ear.
"Bella? Are you all right?"
59 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"I'm fine." My voice sounded strange. I tried to sit up,
and realized he was holding me against the side of his
body in an iron grasp.
"Be careful," he warned as I struggled. "I think you hit
your head pretty hard."
I became aware of a throbbing ache centered above
my left ear.
"Ow," I said, surprised.
"That's what I thought." His voice, amazingly,
sounded like he was suppressing laughter.
"How in the…" I trailed off, trying to clear my head,
get my bearings.
"How did you get over here so fast?"
"I was standing right next to you, Bella," he said, his
tone serious again.
I turned to sit up, and this time he let me, releasing
his hold around my waist and sliding as far from me
as he could in the limited space. I looked at his
concerned, innocent expression and was disoriented
again by the force of his gold-colored eyes. What was I
asking him?
And then they found us, a crowd of people with tears
streaming down their faces, shouting at each other,
shouting at us.
"Don't move," someone instructed.
"Get Tyler out of the van!" someone else shouted.
There was a flurry of activity around us. I tried to get
60 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
up, but Edward's cold hand pushed my shoulder
down.
"Just stay put for now."
"But it's cold," I complained. It surprised me when he
chuckled under his breath. There was an edge to the
sound.
"You were over there," I suddenly remembered, and
his chuckle stopped short. "You were by your car."
His expression turned hard. "No, I wasn't."
"I saw you." All around us was chaos. I could hear the
gruffer voices of adults arriving on the scene. But I
obstinately held on to our argument; I was right, and
he was going to admit it.
"Bella, I was standing with you, and I pulled you out
of the way." He unleashed the full, devastating power
of his eyes on me, as if trying to communicate
something crucial.
"No." I set my jaw.
The gold in his eyes blazed. "Please, Bella."
"Why?" I demanded.
"Trust me," he pleaded, his soft voice overwhelming. I
could hear the sirens now. "Will you promise to
explain everything to me later?"
"Fine," he snapped, abruptly exasperated.
"Fine," I repeated angrily.
61 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
It took six EMTs and two teachers — Mr. Varner and
Coach Clapp — to shift the van far enough away from
us to bring the stretchers in. Edward vehemently
refused his, and I tried to do the same, but the traitor
told them I'd hit my head and probably had a
concussion. I almost died of humiliation when they
put on the neck brace. It looked like the entire school
was there, watching soberly as they loaded me in the
back of the ambulance. Edward got to ride in the
front. It was maddening. To make matters worse,
Chief Swan arrived before they could get me safely
away.
"Bella!" he yelled in panic when he recognized me on
the stretcher.
"I'm completely fine, Char — Dad," I sighed. "There's
nothing wrong with me."
He turned to the closest EMT for a second opinion. I
tuned him out to consider the jumble of inexplicable
images churning chaotically in my head. When they'd
lifted me away from the car, I had seen the deep dent
in the tan car's bumper — a very distinct dent that fit
the contours of Edward's shoulders… as if he had
braced himself against the car with enough force to
damage the metal frame…
And then there was his family, looking on from the
distance, with expressions that ranged from
disapproval to fury but held no hint of concern for
their brother's safety.
I tried to think of a logical solution that could explain
what I had just seen — a solution that excluded the
assumption that I was insane. Naturally, the
62 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
ambulance got a police escort to the county hospital. I
felt ridiculous the whole time they were unloading me.
What made it worse was that Edward simply glided
through the hospital doors under his own power. I
ground my teeth together.
They put me in the emergency room, a long room with
a line of beds separated by pastel-patterned curtains.
A nurse put a pressure cuff on my arm and a
thermometer under my tongue. Since no one bothered
pulling the curtain around to give me some privacy, I
decided I wasn't obligated to wear the stupid-looking
neck brace anymore. When the nurse walked away, I
quickly unfastened the Velcro and threw it under the
bed. There was another flurry of hospital personnel,
another stretcher brought to the bed next to me. I
recognized Tyler Crowley from my Government class
beneath the bloodstained bandages wrapped tightly
around his head. Tyler looked a hundred times worse
than I felt. But he was staring anxiously at me.
"Bella, I'm so sorry!"
"I'm fine, Tyler — you look awful, are you all right?"
As we spoke, nurses began unwinding his soiled
bandages, exposing a myriad of shallow slices all over
his forehead and left cheek.
He ignored me. "I thought I was going to kill you! I
was going too fast, and I hit the ice wrong…" He
winced as one nurse started dabbing at his face.
"Don't worry about it; you missed me."
"How did you get out of the way so fast? You were
there, and then you were gone…" 
"Umm… Edward pulled me out of the way."
He looked confused. "Who?"
"Edward Cullen — he was standing next to me." I'd
always been a terrible liar; I didn't sound convincing
at all.
"Cullen? I didn't see him… wow, it was all so fast, I
guess. Is he okay?"
"I think so. He's here somewhere, but they didn't
make him use a stretcher."
I knew I wasn't crazy. What had happened? There
was no way to explain away what I'd seen.
They wheeled me away then, to X-ray my head. I told
them there was nothing wrong, and I was right. Not
even a concussion. I asked if I could leave, but the
nurse said I had to talk to a doctor first. So I was
trapped in the ER, waiting, harassed by Tyler's
constant apologies and promises to make it up to me.
No matter how many times I tried to convince him I
was fine, he continued to torment himself. Finally, I
closed my eyes and ignored him. He kept up a
remorseful mumbling.
"Is she sleeping?" a musical voice asked. My eyes flew
open. Edward was standing at the foot of my bed,
smirking. I glared at him. It wasn't easy — it would
have been more natural to ogle.
"Hey, Edward, I'm really sorry —" Tyler began.
Edward lifted a hand to stop him.
64 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"No blood, no foul," he said, flashing his brilliant
teeth. He moved to sit on the edge of Tyler's bed,
facing me. He smirked again.
"So, what's the verdict?" he asked me.
"There's nothing wrong with me at all, but they won't
let me go," I complained. "How come you aren't
strapped to a gurney like the rest of us?"
"It's all about who you know," he answered. "But
don't worry, I came to spring you."
Then a doctor walked around the corner, and my
mouth fell open. He was young, he was blond… and
he was handsomer than any movie star I'd ever seen.
He was pale, though, and tired-looking, with circles
under his eyes. From Charlie's description, this had
to be Edward's father.
"So, Miss Swan," Dr. Cullen said in a remarkably
appealing voice, "how are you feeling?"
"I'm fine," I said, for the last time, I hoped. He walked
to the lightboard on the wall over my head, and
turned it on.
"Your X-rays look good," he said. "Does your head
hurt? Edward said you hit it pretty hard."
"It's fine," I repeated with a sigh, throwing a quick
scowl toward Edward. The doctor's cool fingers
probed lightly along my skull. He noticed when I
winced.
"Tender?" he asked.
65 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Not really." I'd had worse.
I heard a chuckle, and looked over to see Edward's
patronizing smile. My eyes narrowed.
"Well, your father is in the waiting room — you can go
home with him now. But come back if you feel dizzy
or have trouble with your eyesight at all."
"Can't I go back to school?" I asked, imagining Charlie
trying to be attentive.
"Maybe you should take it easy today."
I glanced at Edward. "Does he get to go to school?"
"Someone has to spread the good news that we
survived," Edward said smugly.
"Actually," Dr. Cullen corrected, "most of the school
seems to be in the waiting room."
"Oh no," I moaned, covering my face with my hands.
Dr. Cullen raised his eyebrows. "Do you want to
stay?"
"No, no!" I insisted, throwing my legs over the side of
the bed and hopping down quickly. Too quickly — I
staggered, and Dr. Cullen caught me. He looked
concerned.
"I'm fine," I assured him again. No need to tell him my
balance problems had nothing to do with hitting my
head.
"Take some Tylenol for the pain," he suggested as he
steadied me.
66 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"It doesn't hurt that bad," I insisted.
"It sounds like you were extremely lucky," Dr. Cullen
said, smiling as he signed my chart with a flourish.
"Lucky Edward happened to be standing next to me,"
I amended with a hard glance at the subject of my
statement.
"Oh, well, yes," Dr. Cullen agreed, suddenly occupied
with the papers in front of him. Then he looked away,
at Tyler, and walked to the next bed. My intuition
flickered; the doctor was in on it.
"I'm afraid that you'll have to stay with us just a little
bit longer," he said to Tyler, and began checking his
cuts.
As soon as the doctor's back was turned, I moved to
Edward's side.
"Can I talk to you for a minute?" I hissed under my
breath. He took a step back from me, his jaw
suddenly clenched.
"Your father is waiting for you," he said through his
teeth. I glanced at Dr. Cullen and Tyler.
"I'd like to speak with you alone, if you don't mind," I
pressed. He glared, and then turned his back and
strode down the long room. I nearly had to run to
keep up. As soon as we turned the corner into a short
hallway, he spun around to face me.
"What do you want?" he asked, sounding annoyed.
His eyes were cold. His unfriendliness intimidated me.
My words came out with less severity than I'd
67 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
intended. "You owe me an explanation," I reminded
him.
"I saved your life — I don't owe you anything." I
flinched back from the resentment in his voice. "You
promised."
"Bella, you hit your head, you don't know what you're
talking about." His tone was cutting.
My temper flared now, and I glared defiantly at him.
"There's nothing wrong with my head."
He glared back. "What do you want from me, Bella?"
"I want to know the truth," I said. "I want to know
why I'm lying for you."
"What do you think happened?" he snapped.
It came out in a rush.
"All I know is that you weren't anywhere near me —
Tyler didn't see you, either, so don't tell me I hit my
head too hard. That van was going to crush us both
— and it didn't, and your hands left dents in the side
of it — and you left a dent in the other car, and you're
not hurt at all —
and the van should have smashed my legs, but you
were holding it up…" I could hear how crazy it
sounded, and I couldn't continue. I was so mad I
could feel the tears coming; I tried to force them back
by grinding my teeth together.
He was staring at me incredulously. But his face was
tense, defensive.
68 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"You think I lifted a van off you?" His tone questioned
my sanity, but it only made me more suspicious. It
was like a perfectly delivered line by a skilled actor.
I merely nodded once, jaw tight.
"Nobody will believe that, you know." His voice held
an edge of derision now.
"I'm not going to tell anybody." I said each word
slowly, carefully controlling my anger.
Surprise flitted across his face. "Then why does it
matter?"
"It matters to me," I insisted. "I don't like to lie — so
there'd better be a good reason why I'm doing it."
"Can't you just thank me and get over it?"
"Thank you." I waited, fuming and expectant.
"You're not going to let it go, are you?"
"No."
"In that case… I hope you enjoy disappointment." We
scowled at each other in silence. I was the first to
speak, trying to keep myself focused. I was in danger
of being distracted by his livid, glorious face. It was
like trying to stare down a destroying angel.
"Why did you even bother?" I asked frigidly.
He paused, and for a brief moment his stunning face
was unexpectedly vulnerable.
"I don't know," he whispered.
69 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
And then he turned his back on me and walked away.
I was so angry, it took me a few minutes until I could
move. When I could walk, I made my way slowly to
the exit at the end of the hallway. The waiting room
was more unpleasant than I'd feared. It seemed like
every face I knew in Forks was there, staring at me.
Charlie rushed to my side; I put up my hands.
"There's nothing wrong with me," I assured him
sullenly. I was still aggravated, not in the mood for
chitchat.
"What did the doctor say?"
"Dr. Cullen saw me, and he said I was fine and I
could go home." I sighed. Mike and Jessica and Eric
were all there, beginning to converge on us. "Let's go,"
I urged.
Charlie put one arm behind my back, not quite
touching me, and led me to the glass doors of the exit.
I waved sheepishly at my friends, hoping to convey
that they didn't need to worry anymore. It was a huge
relief— the first time I'd ever felt that way — to get
into the cruiser. We drove in silence. I was so
wrapped up in my thoughts that I barely knew
Charlie was there. I was positive that Edward's
defensive behavior in the hall was a confirmation of
the bizarre things I still could hardly believe I'd
witnessed.
When we got to the house, Charlie finally spoke.
"Um… you'll need to call Renée." He hung his head,
guilty. I was appalled. "You told Mom!"
70 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Sorry."
I slammed the cruiser's door a little harder than
necessary on my way out. My mom was in hysterics,
of course. I had to tell her I felt fine at least thirty
times before she would calm down. She begged me to
come home
— forgetting the fact that home was empty at the
moment — but her pleas were easier to resist than I
would have thought. I was consumed by the mystery
Edward presented. And more than a little obsessed by
Edward himself. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I wasn't as
eager to escape Forks as I should be, as any normal,
sane person would be.
I decided I might as well go to bed early that night.
Charlie continued to watch me anxiously, and it was
getting on my nerves. I stopped on my way to grab
three Tylenol from the bathroom. They did help, and,
as the pain eased, I drifted to sleep.
That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen.

71 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
INVITATIONS
In my dream it was very dark, and what dim light
there was seemed to be radiating from Edward's skin.
I couldn't see his face, just his back as he walked
away from me, leaving me in the blackness. No matter
how fast I ran, I couldn't catch up to him; no matter
how loud I called, he never turned. Troubled, I woke
in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep again for
what seemed like a very long time. After that, he was
in my dreams nearly every night, but always on the
periphery, never within reach.
The month that followed the accident was uneasy,
tense, and, at first, embarrassing.
To my dismay, I found myself the center of attention
for the rest of that week. Tyler Crowley was
impossible, following me around, obsessed with
making amends to me somehow. I tried to convince
him what I wanted more than anything else was for
him to forget all about it — especially since nothing
had actually happened to me — but he remained
insistent. He followed me between classes and sat at
our now-crowded lunch table. Mike and Eric were
even less friendly toward him than they were to each
other, which made me worry that I'd gained another
unwelcome fan. No one seemed concerned about
Edward, though I explained over and over that he was
the hero — how he had pulled me out of the way and
had nearly been crushed, too. I tried to be convincing.
Jessica, Mike, Eric, and everyone else always
72 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
commented that they hadn't even seen him there till
the van was pulled away.
I wondered to myself why no one else had seen him
standing so far away, before he was suddenly,
impossibly saving my life. With chagrin, I realized the
probable cause — no one else was as aware of
Edward as I always was. No one else watched him the
way I did. How pitiful. Edward was never surrounded
by crowds of curious bystanders eager for his
firsthand account. People avoided him as usual. The
Cullens and the Hales sat at the same table as
always, not eating, talking only among themselves.
None of them, especially Edward, glanced my way
anymore. When he sat next to me in class, as far from
me as the table would allow, he seemed totally
unaware of my presence. Only now and then, when
his fists would suddenly ball up — skin stretched
even whiter over the bones — did I wonder if he
wasn't quite as oblivious as he appeared. He wished
he hadn't pulled me from the path of Tyler's van —
there was no other conclusion I could come to.
I wanted very much to talk to him, and the day after
the accident I tried. The last time I'd seen him,
outside the ER, we'd both been so furious. I still was
angry that he wouldn't trust me with the truth, even
though I was keeping my part of the bargain
flawlessly. But he had in fact saved my life, no matter
how he'd done it. And, overnight, the heat of my anger
faded into awed gratitude.
He was already seated when I got to Biology, looking
straight ahead. I sat down, expecting him to turn
73 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
toward me. He showed no sign that he realized I was
there.
"Hello, Edward," I said pleasantly, to show him I was
going to behave myself.
He turned his head a fraction toward me without
meeting my gaze, nodded once, and then looked the
other way.
And that was the last contact I'd had with him,
though he was there, a foot away from me, every day.
I watched him sometimes, unable to stop myself—
from a distance, though, in the cafeteria or parking
lot. I watched as his golden eyes grew perceptibly
darker day by day. But in class I gave no more notice
that he existed than he showed toward me. I was
miserable. And the dreams continued.
Despite my outright lies, the tenor of my e-mails
alerted Renée to my depression, and she called a few
times, worried. I tried to convince her it was just the
weather that had me down.
Mike, at least, was pleased by the obvious coolness
between me and my lab partner. I could see he'd been
worried that Edward's daring rescue might have
impressed me, and he was relieved that it seemed to
have the opposite effect. He grew more confident,
sitting on the edge of my table to talk before Biology
class started, ignoring Edward as completely as he
ignored us.
The snow washed away for good after that one
dangerously icy day. Mike was disappointed he'd
never gotten to stage his snowball fight, but pleased
74 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
that the beach trip would soon be possible. The rain
continued heavily, though, and the weeks passed.
Jessica made me aware of another event looming on
the horizon — she called the first Tuesday of March to
ask my permission to invite Mike to the girls' choice
spring dance in two weeks.
"Are you sure you don't mind… you weren't planning
to ask him?" she persisted when I told her I didn't
mind in the least.
"No, Jess, I'm not going," I assured her. Dancing was
glaringly outside my range of abilities.
"It will be really fun." Her attempt to convince me was
halfhearted. I suspected that Jessica enjoyed my
inexplicable popularity more than my actual
company.
"You have fun with Mike," I encouraged.
The next day, I was surprised that Jessica wasn't her
usual gushing self in Trig and Spanish. She was
silent as she walked by my side between classes, and
I was afraid to ask her why. If Mike had turned her
down, I was the last person she would want to tell.
My fears were strengthened during lunch when
Jessica sat as far from Mike as possible, chatting
animatedly with Eric. Mike was unusually quiet. Mike
was still quiet as he walked me to class, the
uncomfortable look on his face a bad sign. But he
didn't broach the subject until I was in my seat and
he was perched on my desk. As always, I was
electrically aware of Edward sitting close enough to
75 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
touch, as distant as if he were merely an invention of
my imagination.
"So," Mike said, looking at the floor, "Jessica asked
me to the spring dance."
"That's great." I made my voice bright and
enthusiastic. "You'll have a lot of fun with Jessica."
"Well…" He floundered as he examined my smile,
clearly not happy with my response. "I told her I had
to think about it."
"Why would you do that?" I let disapproval color my
tone, though I was relieved he hadn't given her an
absolute no.
His face was bright red as he looked down again. Pity
shook my resolve.
"I was wondering if… well, if you might be planning to
ask me." I paused for a moment, hating the wave of
guilt that swept through me. But I saw, from the
corner of my eye, Edward's head tilt reflexively in my
direction.
"Mike, I think you should tell her yes," I said.
"Did you already ask someone?" Did Edward notice
how Mike's eyes flickered in his direction?
"No," I assured him. "I'm not going to the dance at
all."
"Why not?" Mike demanded.
I didn't want to get into the safety hazards that
dancing presented, so I quickly made new plans.
76 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"I'm going to Seattle that Saturday," I explained. I
needed to get out of town anyway — it was suddenly
the perfect time to go.
"Can't you go some other weekend?"
"Sorry, no," I said. "So you shouldn't make Jess wait
any longer — it's rude."
"Yeah, you're right," he mumbled, and turned,
dejected, to walk back to his seat. I closed my eyes
and pressed my fingers to my temples, trying to push
the guilt and sympathy out of my head. Mr. Banner
began talking. I sighed and opened my eyes.
And Edward was staring at me curiously, that same,
familiar edge of frustration even more distinct now in
his black eyes.
I stared back, surprised, expecting him to look
quickly away. But instead he continued to gaze with
probing intensity into my eyes. There was no question
of me looking away. My hands started to shake.
"Mr. Cullen?" the teacher called, seeking the answer
to a question that I hadn't heard.
"The Krebs Cycle," Edward answered, seeming
reluctant as he turned to look at Mr. Banner.
I looked down at my book as soon as his eyes released
me, trying to find my place. Cowardly as ever, I
shifted my hair over my right shoulder to hide my
face. I couldn't believe the rush of emotion pulsing
through me —
77 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
just because he'd happened to look at me for the first
time in a half-dozen weeks. I couldn't allow him to
have this level of influence over me. It was pathetic.
More than pathetic, it was unhealthy. I tried very
hard not to be aware of him for the rest of the hour,
and, since that was impossible, at least not to let him
know that I was aware of him. When the bell rang at
last, I turned my back to him to gather my things,
expecting him to leave immediately as usual.
"Bella?" His voice shouldn't have been so familiar to
me, as if I'd known the sound of it all my life rather
than for just a few short weeks. I turned slowly,
unwillingly. I didn't want to feel what I knew I would
feel when I looked at his too-perfect face. My
expression was wary when I finally turned to him; his
expression was unreadable. He didn't say anything.
"What? Are you speaking to me again?" I finally
asked, an unintentional note of petulance in my
voice.
His lips twitched, fighting a smile. "No, not really," he
admitted. I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly
through my nose, aware that I was gritting my teeth.
He waited.
"Then what do you want, Edward?" I asked, keeping
my eyes closed; it was easier to talk to him coherently
that way.
"I'm sorry." He sounded sincere. "I'm being very rude,
I know. But it's better this way, really."
I opened my eyes. His face was very serious.
78 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"I don't know what you mean," I said, my voice
guarded.
"It's better if we're not friends," he explained. "Trust
me." My eyes narrowed. I'd heard that before.
"It's too bad you didn't figure that out earlier," I
hissed through my teeth. "You could have saved
yourself all this regret."
"Regret?" The word, and my tone, obviously caught
him off guard. "Regret for what?"
"For not just letting that stupid van squish me." He
was astonished. He stared at me in disbelief.
When he finally spoke, he almost sounded mad. "You
think I regret saving your life?"
"I know you do," I snapped.
"You don't know anything." He was definitely mad. I
turned my head sharply away from him, clenching my
jaw against all the wild accusations I wanted to hurl
at him. I gathered my books together, then stood and
walked to the door. I meant to sweep dramatically out
of the room, but of course I caught the toe of my boot
on the door jamb and dropped my books. I stood
there for a moment, thinking about leaving them.
Then I sighed and bent to pick them up. He was
there; he'd already stacked them into a pile. He
handed them to me, his face hard.
"Thank you," I said icily.
His eyes narrowed.
79 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"You're welcome," he retorted.
I straightened up swiftly, turned away from him
again, and stalked off to Gym without looking back.
Gym was brutal. We'd moved on to basketball. My
team never passed me the ball, so that was good, but
I fell down a lot. Sometimes I took people with me.
Today I was worse than usual because my head was
so filled with Edward. I tried to concentrate on my
feet, but he kept creeping back into my thoughts just
when I really needed my balance.
It was a relief, as always, to leave. I almost ran to the
truck; there were just so many people I wanted to
avoid. The truck had suffered only minimal damage in
the accident. I'd had to replace the taillights, and if I'd
had a real paint job, I would have touched that up.
Tyler's parents had to sell their van for parts.
I almost had a stroke when I rounded the corner and
saw a tall, dark figure leaning against the side of my
truck. Then I realized it was just Eric. I started
walking again.
"Hey, Eric," I called.
"Hi, Bella."
"What's up?" I said as I was unlocking the door. I
wasn't paying attention to the uncomfortable edge in
his voice, so his next words took me by surprise.
"Uh, I was just wondering… if you would go to the
spring dance with me?" His voice broke on the last
word.
80 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"I thought it was girls' choice," I said, too startled to
be diplomatic.
"Well, yeah," he admitted, shamefaced.
I recovered my composure and tried to make my smile
warm. "Thank you for asking me, but I'm going to be
in Seattle that day."
"Oh," he said. "Well, maybe next time."
"Sure," I agreed, and then bit my lip. I wouldn't want
him to take that too literally.
He slouched off, back toward the school. I heard a low
chuckle. Edward was walking past the front of my
truck, looking straight forward, his lips pressed
together. I yanked the door open and jumped inside,
slamming it loudly behind me. I revved the engine
deafeningly and reversed out into the aisle. Edward
was in his car already, two spaces down, sliding out
smoothly in front of me, cutting me off. He stopped
there — to wait for his family; I could see the four of
them walking this way, but still by the cafeteria. I
considered taking out the rear of his shiny Volvo, but
there were too many witnesses. I looked in my
rearview mirror. A line was beginning to form. Directly
behind me, Tyler Crowley was in his recently acquired
used Sentra, waving. I was too aggravated to
acknowledge him.
While I was sitting there, looking everywhere but at
the car in front of me, I heard a knock on my
passenger side window. I looked over; it was Tyler. I
glanced back in my rearview mirror, confused. His car
was still running, the door left open. I leaned across
81 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
the cab to crank the window down. It was stiff. I got it
halfway down, then gave up.
"I'm sorry, Tyler, I'm stuck behind Cullen." I was
annoyed — obviously the holdup wasn't my fault.
"Oh, I know — I just wanted to ask you something
while we're trapped here." He grinned.
This could not be happening.
"Will you ask me to the spring dance?" he continued.
"I'm not going to be in town, Tyler." My voice sounded
a little sharp. I had to remember it wasn't his fault
that Mike and Eric had already used up my quota of
patience for the day.
"Yeah, Mike said that," he admitted.
"Then why —"
He shrugged. "I was hoping you were just letting him
down easy." Okay, it was completely his fault.
"Sorry, Tyler," I said, working to hide my irritation. "I
really am going out of town."
"That's cool. We still have prom."
And before I could respond, he was walking back to
his car. I could feel the shock on my face. I looked
forward to see Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper all
sliding into the Volvo. In his rearview mirror,
Edward's eyes were on me. He was unquestionably
shaking with laughter, as if he'd heard every word
Tyler had said. My foot itched toward the gas pedal…
82 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
one little bump wouldn't hurt any of them, just that
glossy silver paint job. I revved the engine.
But they were all in, and Edward was speeding away.
I drove home slowly, carefully, muttering to myself the
whole way.
When I got home, I decided to make chicken
enchiladas for dinner. It was a long process, and it
would keep me busy. While I was simmering the
onions and chilies, the phone rang. I was almost
afraid to answer it, but it might be Charlie or my
mom.
It was Jessica, and she was jubilant; Mike had caught
her after school to accept her invitation. I celebrated
with her briefly while I stirred. She had to go, she
wanted to call Angela and Lauren to tell them. I
suggested — with casual innocence — that maybe
Angela, the shy girl who had Biology with me, could
ask Eric. And Lauren, a standoffish girl who had
always ignored me at the lunch table, could ask Tyler;
I'd heard he was still available. Jess thought that was
a great idea. Now that she was sure of Mike, she
actually sounded sincere when she said she wished I
would go to the dance. I gave her my Seattle excuse.
After I hung up, I tried to concentrate on dinner —
dicing the chicken especially; I didn't want to take
another trip to the emergency room. But my head was
spinning, trying to analyze every word Edward had
spoken today. What did he mean, it was better if we
weren't friends?
My stomach twisted as I realized what he must have
meant. He must see how absorbed I was by him; he
83 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
must not want to lead me on… so we couldn't even be
friends… because he wasn't interested in me at all. Of
course he wasn't interested in me, I thought angrily,
my eyes stinging — a delayed reaction to the onions. I
wasn't interesting. And he was. Interesting… and
brilliant… and mysterious… and perfect… and
beautiful…
and possibly able to lift full-sized vans with one hand.
Well, that was fine. I could leave him alone. I would
leave him alone. I would get through my self-imposed
sentence here in purgatory, and then hopefully some
school in the Southwest, or possibly Hawaii, would
offer me a scholarship. I focused my thoughts on
sunny beaches and palm trees as I finished the
enchiladas and put them in the oven.
Charlie seemed suspicious when he came home and
smelled the green peppers. I couldn't blame him —
the closest edible Mexican food was probably in
southern California. But he was a cop, even if just a
small-town cop, so he was brave enough to take the
first bite. He seemed to like it. It was fun to watch as
he slowly began trusting me in the kitchen.
"Dad?" I asked when he was almost done.
"Yeah, Bella?"
"Um, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to
Seattle for the day a week from Saturday… if that's
okay?" I didn't want to ask permission —
it set a bad precedent — but I felt rude, so I tacked it
on at the end. 
"Why?" He sounded surprised, as if he were unable to
imagine something that Forks couldn't offer.
"Well, I wanted to get few books — the library here is
pretty limited — and maybe look at some clothes." I
had more money than I was used to having, since,
thanks to Charlie, I hadn't had to pay for a car. Not
that the truck didn't cost me quite a bit in the gas
department.
"That truck probably doesn't get very good gas
mileage," he said, echoing my thoughts.
"I know, I'll stop in Montesano and Olympia — and
Tacoma if I have to."
"Are you going all by yourself?" he asked, and I
couldn't tell if he was suspicious I had a secret
boyfriend or just worried about car trouble.
"Yes."
"Seattle is a big city — you could get lost," he fretted.
"Dad, Phoenix is five times the size of Seattle — and I
can read a map, don't worry about it."
"Do you want me to come with you?"
I tried to be crafty as I hid my horror.
"That's all right, Dad, I'll probably just be in dressing
rooms all day — very boring."
"Oh, okay." The thought of sitting in women's clothing
stores for any period of time immediately put him off.
"Thanks." I smiled at him.
85 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Will you be back in time for the dance?"
Grrr. Only in a town this small would a father know
when the high school dances were.
"No — I don't dance, Dad." He, of all people, should
understand that — I didn't get my balance problems
from my mother.
He did understand. "Oh, that's right," he realized. The
next morning, when I pulled into the parking lot, I
deliberately parked as far as possible from the silver
Volvo. I didn't want to put myself in the path of too
much temptation and end up owing him a new car.
Getting out of the cab, I fumbled with my key and it
fell into a puddle at my feet. As I bent to get it, a
white hand flashed out and grabbed it before I could.
I jerked upright. Edward Cullen was right next to me,
leaning casually against my truck.
"How do you do that?" I asked in amazed irritation.
"Do what?" He held my key out as he spoke. As I
reached for it, he dropped it into my palm.
"Appear out of thin air."
"Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally
unobservant." His voice was quiet as usual — velvet,
muted.
I scowled at his perfect face. His eyes were light again
today, a deep, golden honey color. Then I had to look
down, to reassemble my now-tangled thoughts.
86 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Why the traffic jam last night?" I demanded, still
looking away. "I thought you were supposed to be
pretending I don't exist, not irritating me to death."
"That was for Tyler's sake, not mine. I had to give him
his chance." He snickered.
"You…" I gasped. I couldn't think of a bad enough
word. It felt like the heat of my anger should
physically burn him, but he only seemed more
amused.
"And I'm not pretending you don't exist," he
continued.
"So you are trying to irritate me to death? Since
Tyler's van didn't do the job?"
Anger flashed in his tawny eyes. His lips pressed into
a hard line, all signs of humor gone.
"Bella, you are utterly absurd," he said, his low voice
cold. My palms tingled — I wanted so badly to hit
something. I was surprised at myself. I was usually a
nonviolent person. I turned my back and started to
walk away.
"Wait," he called. I kept walking, sloshing angrily
through the rain. But he was next to me, easily
keeping pace.
"I'm sorry, that was rude," he said as we walked. I
ignored him. "I'm not saying it isn't true," he
continued, "but it was rude to say it, anyway."
"Why won't you leave me alone?" I grumbled.
87 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"I wanted to ask you something, but you sidetracked
me," he chuckled. He seemed to have recovered his
good humor.
"Do you have a multiple personality disorder?" I asked
severely.
"You're doing it again."
I sighed. "Fine then. What do you want to ask?"
"I was wondering if, a week from Saturday — you
know, the day of the spring dance —"
"Are you trying to be funny?" I interrupted him,
wheeling toward him. My face got drenched as I
looked up at his expression.
His eyes were wickedly amused. "Will you please allow
me to finish?" I bit my lip and clasped my hands
together, interlocking my fingers, so I couldn't do
anything rash.
"I heard you say you were going to Seattle that day,
and I was wondering if you wanted a ride."
That was unexpected.
"What?" I wasn't sure what he was getting at.
"Do you want a ride to Seattle?"
"With who?" I asked, mystified.
"Myself, obviously." He enunciated every syllable, as if
he were talking to someone mentally handicapped.
I was still stunned. "Why?"
88 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Well, I was planning to go to Seattle in the next few
weeks, and, to be honest, I'm not sure if your truck
can make it."
"My truck works just fine, thank you very much for
your concern." I started to walk again, but I was too
surprised to maintain the same level of anger.
"But can your truck make it there on one tank of
gas?" He matched my pace again.
"I don't see how that is any of your business." Stupid,
shiny Volvo owner.
"The wasting of finite resources is everyone's
business."
"Honestly, Edward." I felt a thrill go through me as I
said his name, and I hated it. "I can't keep up with
you. I thought you didn't want to be my friend."
"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not
that I didn't want to be."
"Oh, thanks, now that's all cleared up." Heavy
sarcasm. I realized I had stopped walking again. We
were under the shelter of the cafeteria roof now, so I
could more easily look at his face. Which certainly
didn't help my clarity of thought.
"It would be more… prudent for you not to be my
friend," he explained.
"But I'm tired of trying to stay away from you, Bella."
His eyes were gloriously intense as he uttered that
last sentence, his voice smoldering. I couldn't
remember how to breathe.
89 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Will you go with me to Seattle?" he asked, still
intense. I couldn't speak yet, so I just nodded.
He smiled briefly, and then his face became serious.
"You really should stay away from me," he warned.
"I'll see you in class." He turned abruptly and walked
back the way we'd come.

90 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
BLOOD TYPE
I made my way to English in a daze. I didn't even
realize when I first walked in that class had already
started.
"Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan," Mr. Mason
said in a disparaging tone.
I flushed and hurried to my seat.
It wasn't till class ended that I realized Mike wasn't
sitting in his usual seat next to me. I felt a twinge of
guilt. But he and Eric both met me at the door as
usual, so I figured I wasn't totally unforgiven. Mike
seemed to become more himself as we walked, gaining
enthusiasm as he talked about the weather report for
this weekend. The rain was supposed to take a minor
break, and so maybe his beach trip would be
possible. I tried to sound eager, to make up for
disappointing him yesterday. It was hard; rain or no
rain, it would still only be in the high forties, if we
were lucky.
The rest of the morning passed in a blur. It was
difficult to believe that I hadn't just imagined what
Edward had said, and the way his eyes had looked.
Maybe it was just a very convincing dream that I'd
confused with reality. That seemed more probable
than that I really appealed to him on any level.
So I was impatient and frightened as Jessica and I
entered the cafeteria. I wanted to see his face, to see if
91 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
he'd gone back to the cold, indifferent person I'd
known for the last several weeks. Or if, by some
miracle, I'd really heard what I thought I'd heard this
morning. Jessica babbled on and on about her dance
plans — Lauren and Angela had asked the other boys
and they were all going together — completely
unaware of my inattention.
Disappointment flooded through me as my eyes
unerringly focused on his table. The other four were
there, but he was absent. Had he gone home? I
followed the still-babbling Jessica through the line,
crushed. I'd lost my appetite — I bought nothing but
a bottle of lemonade. I just wanted to go sit down and
sulk.
"Edward Cullen is staring at you again," Jessica said,
finally breaking through my abstraction with his
name. "I wonder why he's sitting alone today."
My head snapped up. I followed her gaze to see
Edward, smiling crookedly, staring at me from an
empty table across the cafeteria from where he
usually sat. Once he'd caught my eye, he raised one
hand and motioned with his index finger for me to
join him. As I stared in disbelief, he winked.
"Does he mean you?" Jessica asked with insulting
astonishment in her voice.
"Maybe he needs help with his Biology homework," I
muttered for her benefit. "Um, I'd better go see what
he wants." I could feel her staring after me as I
walked away.
92 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
When I reached his table, I stood behind the chair
across from him, unsure.
"Why don't you sit with me today?" he asked, smiling.
I sat down automatically, watching him with caution.
He was still smiling. It was hard to believe that
someone so beautiful could be real. I was afraid that
he might disappear in a sudden puff of smoke, and I
would wake up.
He seemed to be waiting for me to say something.
"This is different," I finally managed.
"Well…" He paused, and then the rest of the words
followed in a rush. "I decided as long as I was going to
hell, I might as well do it thoroughly." I waited for him
to say something that made sense. The seconds
ticked by.
"You know I don't have any idea what you mean," I
eventually pointed out.
"I know." He smiled again, and then he changed the
subject. "I think your friends are angry with me for
stealing you."
"They'll survive." I could feel their stares boring into
my back.
"I may not give you back, though," he said with a
wicked glint in his eyes.
I gulped.
He laughed. "You look worried."
93 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"No," I said, but, ridiculously, my voice broke.
"Surprised, actually…
what brought all this on?"
"I told you — I got tired of trying to stay away from
you. So I'm giving up." He was still smiling, but his
ocher eyes were serious.
"Giving up?" I repeated in confusion.
"Yes — giving up trying to be good. I'm just going to
do what I want now, and let the chips fall where they
may." His smile faded as he explained, and a hard
edge crept into his voice.
"You lost me again."
The breathtaking crooked smile reappeared.
"I always say too much when I'm talking to you —
that's one of the problems."
"Don't worry — I don't understand any of it," I said
wryly.
"I'm counting on that."
"So, in plain English, are we friends now?"
"Friends…" he mused, dubious.
"Or not," I muttered.
He grinned. "Well, we can try, I suppose. But I'm
warning you now that I'm not a good friend for you."
Behind his smile, the warning was real.
94 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"You say that a lot," I noted, trying to ignore the
sudden trembling in my stomach and keep my voice
even.
"Yes, because you're not listening to me. I'm still
waiting for you to believe it. If you're smart, you'll
avoid me."
"I think you've made your opinion on the subject of
my intellect clear, too." My eyes narrowed.
He smiled apologetically.
"So, as long as I'm being… not smart, we'll try to be
friends?" I struggled to sum up the confusing
exchange.
"That sounds about right."
I looked down at my hands wrapped around the
lemonade bottle, not sure what to do now.
"What are you thinking?" he asked curiously.
I looked up into his deep gold eyes, became
befuddled, and, as usual, blurted out the truth.
"I'm trying to figure out what you are."
His jaw tightened, but he kept his smile in place with
some effort.
"Are you having any luck with that?" he asked in an
offhand tone.
"Not too much," I admitted.
He chuckled. "What are your theories?"
95 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
I blushed. I had been vacillating during the last
month between Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker. There
was no way I was going to own up to that.
"Won't you tell me?" he asked, tilting his head to one
side with a shockingly tempting smile.
I shook my head. "Too embarrassing."
"That's really frustrating, you know," he complained.
"No," I disagreed quickly, my eyes narrowing, "I can't
imagine why that would be frustrating at all — just
because someone refuses to tell you what they're
thinking, even if all the while they're making cryptic
little remarks specifically designed to keep you up at
night wondering what they could possibly mean…
now, why would that be frustrating?" He grimaced.
"Or better," I continued, the pent-up annoyance
flowing freely now, "say that person also did a wide
range of bizarre things — from saving your life under
impossible circumstances one day to treating you like
a pariah the next, and he never explained any of that,
either, even after he promised. That, also, would be
very non-frustrating."
"You've got a bit of a temper, don't you?"
"I don't like double standards."
We stared at each other, unsmiling.
He glanced over my shoulder, and then,
unexpectedly, he snickered.
"What?"
96 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Your boyfriend seems to think I'm being unpleasant
to you — he's debating whether or not to come break
up our fight." He snickered again.
"I don't know who you're talking about," I said frostily.
"But I'm sure you're wrong, anyway."
"I'm not. I told you, most people are easy to read."
"Except me, of course."
"Yes. Except for you." His mood shifted suddenly; his
eyes turned brooding. "I wonder why that is."
I had to look away from the intensity of his stare. I
concentrated on unscrewing the lid of my lemonade. I
took a swig, staring at the table without seeing it.
"Aren't you hungry?" he asked, distracted.
"No." I didn't feel like mentioning that my stomach
was already full — of butterflies. "You?" I looked at
the empty table in front of him.
"No, I'm not hungry." I didn't understand his
expression — it looked like he was enjoying some
private joke.
"Can you do me a favor?" I asked after a second of
hesitation. He was suddenly wary. "That depends on
what you want."
"It's not much," I assured him.
He waited, guarded but curious.
"I just wondered… if you could warn me beforehand
the next time you decide to ignore me for my own
97 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
good. Just so I'm prepared." I looked at the lemonade
bottle as I spoke, tracing the circle of the opening with
my pinkie finger.
"That sounds fair." He was pressing his lips together
to keep from laughing when I looked up.
"Thanks."
"Then can I have one answer in return?" he
demanded.
"One."
"Tell me one theory."
Whoops. "Not that one."
"You didn't qualify, you just promised one answer," he
reminded me.
"And you've broken promises yourself," I reminded
him back.
"Just one theory — I won't laugh."
"Yes, you will." I was positive about that.
He looked down, and then glanced up at me through
his long black lashes, his ocher eyes scorching.
"Please?" he breathed, leaning toward me.
I blinked, my mind going blank. Holy crow, how did
he do that?
"Er, what?" I asked, dazed.
98 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Please tell me just one little theory." His eyes still
smoldered at me.
"Um, well, bitten by a radioactive spider?" Was he a
hypnotist, too? Or was I just a hopeless pushover?
"That's not very creative," he scoffed.
"I'm sorry, that's all I've got," I said, miffed.
"You're not even close," he teased.
"No spiders?"
"Nope."
"And no radioactivity?"
"None."
"Dang," I sighed.
"Kryptonite doesn't bother me, either," he chuckled.
"You're not supposed to laugh, remember?"
He struggled to compose his face.
"I'll figure it out eventually," I warned him.
"I wish you wouldn't try." He was serious again.
"Because… ?"
"What if I'm not a superhero? What if I'm the bad
guy?" He smiled playfully, but his eyes were
impenetrable.
"Oh," I said, as several things he'd hinted fell
suddenly into place. "I see."
99 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Do you?" His face was abruptly severe, as if he were
afraid that he'd accidentally said too much.
"You're dangerous?" I guessed, my pulse quickening
as I intuitively realized the truth of my own words. He
was dangerous. He'd been trying to tell me that all
along.
He just looked at me, eyes full of some emotion I
couldn't comprehend.
"But not bad," I whispered, shaking my head. "No, I
don't believe that you're bad."
"You're wrong." His voice was almost inaudible. He
looked down, stealing my bottle lid and then spinning
it on its side between his fingers. I stared at him,
wondering why I didn't feel afraid. He meant what he
was saying — that was obvious. But I just felt
anxious, on edge… and, more than anything else,
fascinated. The same way I always felt when I was
near him.
The silence lasted until I noticed that the cafeteria
was almost empty. I jumped to my feet. "We're going
to be late."
"I'm not going to class today," he said, twirling the lid
so fast it was just a blur.
"Why not?"
"It's healthy to ditch class now and then." He smiled
up at me, but his eyes were still troubled.
"Well, I'm going," I told him. I was far too big a coward
to risk getting caught.
100 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
He turned his attention back to his makeshift top. "I'll
see you later, then."
I hesitated, torn, but then the first bell sent me
hurrying out the door
— with a last glance confirming that he hadn't moved
a centimeter. As I half-ran to class, my head was
spinning faster than the bottle cap. So few questions
had been answered in comparison to how many new
questions had been raised. At least the rain had
stopped. I was lucky; Mr. Banner wasn't in the room
yet when I arrived. I settled quickly into my seat,
aware that both Mike and Angela were staring at me.
Mike looked resentful; Angela looked surprised, and
slightly awed. Mr. Banner came in the room then,
calling the class to order. He was juggling a few small
cardboard boxes in his arms. He put them down on
Mike's table, telling him to start passing them around
the class.
"Okay, guys, I want you all to take one piece from
each box," he said as he produced a pair of rubber
gloves from the pocket of his lab jacket and pulled
them on. The sharp sound as the gloves snapped into
place against his wrists seemed ominous to me. "The
first should be an indicator card," he went on,
grabbing a white card with four squares marked on it
and displaying it. "The second is a four-pronged
applicator —" he held up something that looked like a
nearly toothless hair pick "— and the third is a sterile
micro-lancet." He held up a small piece of blue plastic
and split it open. The barb was invisible from this
distance, but my stomach flipped.
101 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"I'll be coming around with a dropper of water to
prepare your cards, so please don't start until I get to
you." He began at Mike's table again, carefully putting
one drop of water in each of the four squares. "Then I
want you to carefully prick your finger with the
lancet…" He grabbed Mike's hand and jabbed the
spike into the tip of Mike's middle finger. Oh no.
Clammy moisture broke out across my forehead.
"Put a small drop of blood on each of the prongs." He
demonstrated, squeezing Mike's finger till the blood
flowed. I swallowed convulsively, my stomach
heaving.
"And then apply it to the card," he finished, holding
up the dripping red card for us to see. I closed my
eyes, trying to hear through the ringing in my ears.
"The Red Cross is having a blood drive in Port Angeles
next weekend, so I thought you should all know your
blood type." He sounded proud of himself. "Those of
you who aren't eighteen yet will need a parent's
permission — I have slips at my desk."
He continued through the room with his water drops.
I put my cheek against the cool black tabletop and
tried to hold on to my consciousness. All around me I
could hear squeals, complaints, and giggles as my
classmates skewered their fingers. I breathed slowly
in and out through my mouth.
"Bella, are you all right?" Mr. Banner asked. His voice
was close to my head, and it sounded alarmed.
"I already know my blood type, Mr. Banner," I said in
a weak voice. I was afraid to raise my head.
102 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Are you feeling faint?"
"Yes, sir," I muttered, internally kicking myself for not
ditching when I had the chance.
"Can someone take Bella to the nurse, please?" he
called. I didn't have to look up to know that it would
be Mike who volunteered.
"Can you walk?" Mr. Banner asked.
"Yes," I whispered. Just let me get out of here, I
thought. I'll crawl. Mike seemed eager as he put his
arm around my waist and pulled my arm over his
shoulder. I leaned against him heavily on the way out
of the classroom.
Mike towed me slowly across campus. When we were
around the edge of the cafeteria, out of sight of
building four in case Mr. Banner was watching, I
stopped.
"Just let me sit for a minute, please?" I begged. He
helped me sit on the edge of the walk.
"And whatever you do, keep your hand in your
pocket," I warned. I was still so dizzy. I slumped over
on my side, putting my cheek against the freezing,
damp cement of the sidewalk, closing my eyes. That
seemed to help a little.
"Wow, you're green, Bella," Mike said nervously.
"Bella?" a different voice called from the distance. No!
Please let me be imagining that horribly familiar
voice.
103 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"What's wrong — is she hurt?" His voice was closer
now, and he sounded upset. I wasn't imagining it. I
squeezed my eyes shut, hoping to die. Or, at the very
least, not to throw up.
Mike seemed stressed. "I think she's fainted. I don't
know what happened, she didn't even stick her
finger."
"Bella." Edward's voice was right beside me, relieved
now. "Can you hear me?"
"No," I groaned. "Go away."
He chuckled.
"I was taking her to the nurse," Mike explained in a
defensive tone, "but she wouldn't go any farther."
"I'll take her," Edward said. I could hear the smile still
in his voice.
"You can go back to class."
"No," Mike protested. "I'm supposed to do it."
Suddenly the sidewalk disappeared from beneath me.
My eyes flew open in shock. Edward had scooped me
up in his arms, as easily as if I weighed ten pounds
instead of a hundred and ten.
"Put me down!" Please, please let me not vomit on
him. He was walking before I was finished talking.
"Hey!" Mike called, already ten paces behind us.
Edward ignored him. "You look awful," he told me,
grinning.
104 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Put me back on the sidewalk," I moaned. The rocking
movement of his walk was not helping. He held me
away from his body, gingerly, supporting all my
weight with just his arms — it didn't seem to bother
him.
"So you faint at the sight of blood?" he asked. This
seemed to entertain him.
I didn't answer. I closed my eyes again and fought the
nausea with all my strength, clamping my lips
together.
"And not even your own blood," he continued,
enjoying himself. I don't know how he opened the
door while carrying me, but it was suddenly warm, so
I knew we were inside.
"Oh my," I heard a female voice gasp.
"She fainted in Biology," Edward explained.
I opened my eyes. I was in the office, and Edward was
striding past the front counter toward the nurse's
door. Ms. Cope, the redheaded front office
receptionist, ran ahead of him to hold it open. The
grandmotherly nurse looked up from a novel,
astonished, as Edward swung me into the room and
placed me gently on the crackly paper that covered
the brown vinyl mattress on the one cot. Then he
moved to stand against the wall as far across the
narrow room as possible. His eyes were bright,
excited.
"She's just a little faint," he reassured the startled
nurse. "They're blood typing in Biology."
105 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
The nurse nodded sagely. "There's always one."
He muffled a snicker.
"Just lie down for a minute, honey; it'll pass."
"I know," I sighed. The nausea was already fading.
"Does this happen a lot?" she asked.
"Sometimes," I admitted. Edward coughed to hide
another laugh.
"You can go back to class now," she told him.
"I'm supposed to stay with her." He said this with
such assured authority that — even though she
pursed her lips — the nurse didn't argue it further.
"I'll go get you some ice for your forehead, dear," she
said to me, and then bustled out of the room.
"You were right," I moaned, letting my eyes close.
"I usually am — but about what in particular this
time?"
"Ditching is healthy." I practiced breathing evenly.
"You scared me for a minute there," he admitted after
a pause. His tone made it sound like he was
confessing a humiliating weakness. "I thought Newton
was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the
woods."
"Ha ha." I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling
more normal every minute.
106 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Honestly — I've seen corpses with better color. I was
concerned that I might have to avenge your murder."
"Poor Mike. I'll bet he's mad."
"He absolutely loathes me," Edward said cheerfully.
"You can't know that," I argued, but then I wondered
suddenly if he could.
"I saw his face — I could tell."
"How did you see me? I thought you were ditching." I
was almost fine now, though the queasiness would
probably pass faster if I'd eaten something for lunch.
On the other hand, maybe it was lucky my stomach
was empty.
"I was in my car, listening to a CD." Such a normal
response — it surprised me.
I heard the door and opened my eyes to see the nurse
with a cold compress in her hand.
"Here you go, dear." She laid it across my forehead.
"You're looking better," she added.
"I think I'm fine," I said, sitting up. Just a little
ringing in my ears, no spinning. The mint green walls
stayed where they should. I could see she was about
to make me lie back down, but the door opened just
then, and Ms. Cope stuck her head in.
"We've got another one," she warned.
I hopped down to free up the cot for the next invalid.
107 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
I handed the compress back to the nurse. "Here, I
don't need this." And then Mike staggered through the
door, now supporting a sallow-looking Lee Stephens,
another boy in our Biology class. Edward and I drew
back against the wall to give them room.
"Oh no," Edward muttered. "Go out to the office,
Bella." I looked up at him, bewildered.
"Trust me — go."
I spun and caught the door before it closed, darting
out of the infirmary. I could feel Edward right behind
me.
"You actually listened to me." He was stunned.
"I smelled the blood," I said, wrinkling my nose. Lee
wasn't sick from watching other people, like me.
"People can't smell blood," he contradicted.
"Well, I can — that's what makes me sick. It smells
like rust… and salt." He was staring at me with an
unfathomable expression.
"What?" I asked.
"It's nothing."
Mike came through the door then, glancing from me
to Edward. The look he gave Edward confirmed what
Edward had said about loathing. He looked back at
me, his eyes glum.
"You look better," he accused.
108 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Just keep your hand in your pocket," I warned him
again.
"It's not bleeding anymore," he muttered. "Are you
going back to class?"
"Are you kidding? I'd just have to turn around and
come back."
"Yeah, I guess… So are you going this weekend? To
the beach?" While he spoke, he flashed another glare
toward Edward, who was standing against the
cluttered counter, motionless as a sculpture, staring
off into space. I tried to sound as friendly as possible.
"Sure, I said I was in."
"We're meeting at my dad's store, at ten." His eyes
flickered to Edward again, wondering if he was giving
out too much information. His body language made it
clear that it wasn't an open invitation.
"I'll be there," I promised.
"I'll see you in Gym, then," he said, moving
uncertainly toward the door.
"See you," I replied. He looked at me once more, his
round face slightly pouting, and then as he walked
slowly through the door, his shoulders slumped. A
swell of sympathy washed over me. I pondered seeing
his disappointed face again… in Gym.
"Gym," I groaned.
"I can take care of that." I hadn't noticed Edward
moving to my side, but he spoke now in my ear. "Go
sit down and look pale," he muttered. That wasn't a
109 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
challenge; I was always pale, and my recent swoon
had left a light sheen of sweat on my face. I sat in one
of the creaky folding chairs and rested my head
against the wall with my eyes closed. Fainting spells
always exhausted me.
I heard Edward speaking softly at the counter.
"Ms. Cope?"
"Yes?" I hadn't heard her return to her desk.
"Bella has Gym next hour, and I don't think she feels
well enough. Actually, I was thinking I should take
her home now. Do you think you could excuse her
from class?" His voice was like melting honey. I could
imagine how much more overwhelming his eyes
would be.
"Do you need to be excused, too, Edward?" Ms. Cope
fluttered. Why couldn't I do that?
"No, I have Mrs. Goff, she won't mind."
"Okay, it's all taken care of. You feel better, Bella,"
she called to me. I nodded weakly, hamming it up just
a bit.
"Can you walk, or do you want me to carry you
again?" With his back to the receptionist, his
expression became sarcastic.
"I'll walk."
I stood carefully, and I was still fine. He held the door
for me, his smile polite but his eyes mocking. I walked
out into the cold, fine mist that had just begun to fall.
110 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
It felt nice — the first time I'd enjoyed the constant
moisture falling out of the sky — as it washed my face
clean of the sticky perspiration.
"Thanks," I said as he followed me out. "It's almost
worth getting sick to miss Gym."
"Anytime." He was staring straight forward, squinting
into the rain.
"So are you going? This Saturday, I mean?" I was
hoping he would, though it seemed unlikely. I
couldn't picture him loading up to carpool with the
rest of the kids from school; he didn't belong in the
same world. But just hoping that he might gave me
the first twinge of enthusiasm I'd felt for the outing.
"Where are you all going, exactly?" He was still
looking ahead, expressionless.
"Down to La Push, to First Beach." I studied his face,
trying to read it. His eyes seemed to narrow
infinitesimally.
He glanced down at me from the corner of his eye,
smiling wryly. "I really don't think I was invited."
I sighed. "I just invited you."
"Let's you and I not push poor Mike any further this
week. We don't want him to snap." His eyes danced;
he was enjoying the idea more than he should.
"Mike-schmike." I muttered, preoccupied by the way
he'd said "you and I." I liked it more than I should.
111 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
We were near the parking lot now. I veered left,
toward my truck. Something caught my jacket,
yanking me back.
"Where do you think you're going?" he asked,
outraged. He was gripping a fistful of my jacket in one
hand.
I was confused. "I'm going home."
"Didn't you hear me promise to take you safely home?
Do you think I'm going to let you drive in your
condition?" His voice was still indignant.
"What condition? And what about my truck?" I
complained.
"I'll have Alice drop it off after school." He was towing
me toward his car now, pulling me by my jacket. It
was all I could do to keep from falling backward. He'd
probably just drag me along anyway if I did.
"Let go!" I insisted. He ignored me. I staggered along
sideways across the wet sidewalk until we reached
the Volvo. Then he finally freed me — I stumbled
against the passenger door.
"You are so pushy!" I grumbled.
"It's open," was all he responded. He got in the
driver's side.
"I am perfectly capable of driving myself home!" I
stood by the car, fuming. It was raining harder now,
and I'd never put my hood up, so my hair was
dripping down my back.
112 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
He lowered the automatic window and leaned toward
me across the seat.
"Get in, Bella."
I didn't answer. I was mentally calculating my
chances of reaching the truck before he could catch
me. I had to admit, they weren't good.
"I'll just drag you back," he threatened, guessing my
plan. I tried to maintain what dignity I could as I got
into his car. I wasn't very successful — I looked like a
half-drowned cat and my boots squeaked.
"This is completely unnecessary," I said stiffly. He
didn't answer. He fiddled with the controls, turning
the heater up and the music down. As he pulled out
of the parking lot, I was preparing to give him the
silent treatment — my face in full pout mode — but
then I recognized the music playing, and my curiosity
got the better of my intentions.
"Clair de Lune?" I asked, surprised.
"You know Debussy?" He sounded surprised, too.
"Not well," I admitted. "My mother plays a lot of
classical music around the house — I only know my
favorites."
"It's one of my favorites, too." He stared out through
the rain, lost in thought.
I listened to the music, relaxing against the light gray
leather seat. It was impossible not to respond to the
familiar, soothing melody. The rain blurred everything
outside the window into gray and green smudges. I
113 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
began to realize we were driving very fast; the car
moved so steadily, so evenly, though, I didn't feel the
speed. Only the town flashing by gave it away.
"What is your mother like?" he asked me suddenly. I
glanced over to see him studying me with curious
eyes.
"She looks a lot like me, but she's prettier," I said. He
raised his eyebrows. "I have too much Charlie in me.
She's more outgoing than I am, and braver. She's
irresponsible and slightly eccentric, and she's a very
unpredictable cook. She's my best friend." I stopped.
Talking about her was making me depressed.
"How old are you, Bella?" His voice sounded
frustrated for some reason I couldn't imagine. He'd
stopped the car, and I realized we were at Charlie's
house already. The rain was so heavy that I could
barely see the house at all. It was like the car was
submerged under a river.
"I'm seventeen," I responded, a little confused.
"You don't seem seventeen."
His tone was reproachful; it made me laugh.
"What?" he asked, curious again.
"My mom always says I was born thirty-five years old
and that I get more middle-aged every year." I
laughed, and then sighed. "Well, someone has to be
the adult." I paused for a second. "You don't seem
much like a junior in high school yourself," I noted.
He made a face and changed the subject.
114 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"So why did your mother marry Phil?"
I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd
mentioned it just once, almost two months ago. It
took me a moment to answer.
"My mother… she's very young for her age. I think
Phil makes her feel even younger. At any rate, she's
crazy about him." I shook my head. The attraction
was a mystery to me.
"Do you approve?" he asked.
"Does it matter?" I countered. "I want her to be
happy… and he is who she wants."
"That's very generous… I wonder," he mused.
"What?"
"Would she extend the same courtesy to you, do you
think? No matter who your choice was?" He was
suddenly intent, his eyes searching mine.
"I-I think so," I stuttered. "But she's the parent, after
all. It's a little bit different."
"No one too scary then," he teased.
I grinned in response. "What do you mean by scary?
Multiple facial piercings and extensive tattoos?"
"That's one definition, I suppose."
"What's your definition?"
But he ignored my question and asked me another.
"Do you think that I could be scary?" He raised one
115 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smile lightened his
face.
I thought for a moment, wondering whether the truth
or a lie would go over better. I decided to go with the
truth. "Hmmm… I think you could be, if you wanted
to."
"Are you frightened of me now?" The smile vanished,
and his heavenly face was suddenly serious.
"No." But I answered too quickly. The smile returned.
"So, now are you going to tell me about your family?" I
asked to distract him. "It's got to be a much more
interesting story than mine." He was instantly
cautious. "What do you want to know?"
"The Cullens adopted you?" I verified.
"Yes."
I hesitated for a moment. "What happened to your
parents?"
"They died many years ago." His tone was matter-offact.
"I'm sorry," I mumbled.
"I don't really remember them that clearly. Carlisle
and Esme have been my parents for a long time now."
"And you love them." It wasn't a question. It was
obvious in the way he spoke of them.
"Yes." He smiled. "I couldn't imagine two better
people."
116 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"You're very lucky."
"I know I am."
"And your brother and sister?"
He glanced at the clock on the dashboard.
"My brother and sister, and Jasper and Rosalie for
that matter, are going to be quite upset if they have to
stand in the rain waiting for me."
"Oh, sorry, I guess you have to go." I didn't want to
get out of the car.
"And you probably want your truck back before Chief
Swan gets home, so you don't have to tell him about
the Biology incident." He grinned at me.
"I'm sure he's already heard. There are no secrets in
Forks." I sighed. He laughed, and there was an edge
to his laughter.
"Have fun at the beach… good weather for
sunbathing." He glanced out at the sheeting rain.
"Won't I see you tomorrow?"
"No. Emmett and I are starting the weekend early."
"What are you going to do?" A friend could ask that,
right? I hoped the disappointment wasn't too
apparent in my voice.
"We're going to be hiking in the Goat Rocks
Wilderness, just south of Rainier."
I remembered Charlie had said the Cullens went
camping frequently.
117 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Oh, well, have fun." I tried to sound enthusiastic. I
don't think I fooled him, though. A smile was playing
around the edges of his lips.
"Will you do something for me this weekend?" He
turned to look me straight in the face, utilizing the
full power of his burning gold eyes. I nodded
helplessly.
"Don't be offended, but you seem to be one of those
people who just attract accidents like a magnet. So…
try not to fall into the ocean or get run over or
anything, all right?" He smiled crookedly. The
helplessness had faded as he spoke. I glared at him.
"I'll see what I can do," I snapped as I jumped out into
the rain. I slammed the door behind me with
excessive force.
He was still smiling as he drove away.

SCARY STORIES
As I sat in my room, trying to concentrate on the third
act of Macbeth, I was really listening for my truck. I
would have thought, even over the pounding rain, I
could have heard the engine's roar. But when I went
to peek out the curtain — again — it was suddenly
there.
I wasn't looking forward to Friday, and it more than
lived up to my non-expectations. Of course there were
the fainting comments. Jessica especially seemed to
get a kick out of that story. Luckily Mike had kept his
mouth shut, and no one seemed to know about
Edward's involvement. She did have a lot of questions
about lunch, though.
"So what did Edward Cullen want yesterday?" Jessica
asked in Trig.
"I don't know," I answered truthfully. "He never really
got to the point."
"You looked kind of mad," she fished.
"Did I?" I kept my expression blank.
"You know, I've never seen him sit with anyone but
his family before. That was weird."
"Weird," I agreed. She seemed annoyed; she flipped
her dark curls impatiently — I guessed she'd been
hoping to hear something that would make a good
story for her to pass on.
119 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
The worst part about Friday was that, even though I
knew he wasn't going to be there, I still hoped. When I
walked into the cafeteria with Jessica and Mike, I
couldn't keep from looking at his table, where Rosalie,
Alice, and Jasper sat talking, heads close together.
And I couldn't stop the gloom that engulfed me as I
realized I didn't know how long I would have to wait
before I saw him again.
At my usual table, everyone was full of our plans for
the next day. Mike was animated again, putting a
great deal of trust in the local weatherman who
promised sun tomorrow. I'd have to see that before I
believed it. But it was warmer today — almost sixty.
Maybe the outing wouldn't be completely miserable.
I intercepted a few unfriendly glances from Lauren
during lunch, which I didn't understand until we were
all walking out of the room together. I was right
behind her, just a foot from her slick, silver blond
hair, and she was evidently unaware of that.
"…don't know why Bella" — she sneered my name —
"doesn't just sit with the Cullens from now on."
I heard her muttering to Mike. I'd never noticed what
an unpleasant, nasal voice she had, and I was
surprised by the malice in it. I really didn't know her
well at all, certainly not well enough for her to dislike
me — or so I'd thought. "She's my friend; she sits
with us," Mike whispered back loyally, but also a bit
territorially. I paused to let Jess and Angela pass me.
I didn't want to hear any more.
That night at dinner, Charlie seemed enthusiastic
about my trip to La Push in the morning. I think he
120 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
felt guilty for leaving me home alone on the weekends,
but he'd spent too many years building his habits to
break them now. Of course he knew the names of all
the kids going, and their parents, and their greatgrandparents, too, probably. He seemed to approve. I
wondered if he would approve of my plan to ride to
Seattle with Edward Cullen. Not that I was going to
tell him.
"Dad, do you know a place called Goat Rocks or
something like that? I think it's south of Mount
Rainier," I asked casually.
"Yeah — why?"
I shrugged. "Some kids were talking about camping
there."
"It's not a very good place for camping." He sounded
surprised. "Too many bears. Most people go there
during the hunting season."
"Oh," I murmured. "Maybe I got the name wrong." I
meant to sleep in, but an unusual brightness woke
me. I opened my eyes to see a clear yellow light
streaming through my window. I couldn't believe it. I
hurried to the window to check, and sure enough,
there was the sun. It was in the wrong place in the
sky, too low, and it didn't seem to be as close as it
should be, but it was definitely the sun. Clouds
ringed the horizon, but a large patch of blue was
visible in the middle. I lingered by the window as long
as I could, afraid that if I left the blue would
disappear again.
121 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
The Newtons' Olympic Outfitters store was just north
of town. I'd seen the store, but I'd never stopped there
— not having much need for any supplies required for
being outdoors over an extended period of time. In the
parking lot I recognized Mike's Suburban and Tyler's
Sentra. As I pulled up next to their vehicles, I could
see the group standing around in front of the
Suburban. Eric was there, along with two other boys I
had class with; I was fairly sure their names were Ben
and Conner. Jess was there, flanked by Angela and
Lauren. Three other girls stood with them, including
one I remembered falling over in Gym on Friday. That
one gave me a dirty look as I got out of the truck, and
whispered something to Lauren. Lauren shook out
her cornsilk hair and eyed me scornfully. So it was
going to be one of those days.
At least Mike was happy to see me.
"You came!" he called, delighted. "And I said it would
be sunny today, didn't I?"
"I told you I was coming," I reminded him.
"We're just waiting for Lee and Samantha… unless
you invited someone," Mike added.
"Nope," I lied lightly, hoping I wouldn't get caught in
the lie. But also wishing that a miracle would occur,
and Edward would appear. Mike looked satisfied.
"Will you ride in my car? It's that or Lee's mom's
minivan."
"Sure."
122 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
He smiled blissfully. It was so easy to make Mike
happy.
"You can have shotgun," he promised. I hid my
chagrin. It wasn't as simple to make Mike and Jessica
happy at the same time. I could see Jessica glowering
at us now.
The numbers worked out in my favor, though. Lee
brought two extra people, and suddenly every seat
was necessary. I managed to wedge Jess in between
Mike and me in the front seat of the Suburban. Mike
could have been more graceful about it, but at least
Jess seemed appeased.
It was only fifteen miles to La Push from Forks, with
gorgeous, dense green forests edging the road most of
the way and the wide Quillayute River snaking
beneath it twice. I was glad I had the window seat.
We'd rolled the windows down — the Suburban was a
bit claustrophobic with nine people in it — and I tried
to absorb as much sunlight as possible. I'd been to
the beaches around La Push many times during my
Forks summers with Charlie, so the mile-long
crescent of First Beach was familiar to me. It was still
breathtaking. The water was dark gray, even in the
sunlight, white-capped and heaving to the gray, rocky
shore. Islands rose out of the steel harbor waters with
sheer cliff sides, reaching to uneven summits, and
crowned with austere, soaring firs. The beach had
only a thin border of actual sand at the water's edge,
after which it grew into millions of large, smooth
stones that looked uniformly gray from a distance,
but close up were every shade a stone could be: terracotta, sea green, lavender, blue gray, dull gold. The
123 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
tide line was strewn with huge driftwood trees,
bleached bone white in the salt waves, some piled
together against the edge of the forest fringe, some
lying solitary, just out of reach of the waves.
There was a brisk wind coming off the waves, cool
and briny. Pelicans floated on the swells while
seagulls and a lone eagle wheeled above them. The
clouds still circled the sky, threatening to invade at
any moment, but for now the sun shone bravely in its
halo of blue sky. We picked our way down to the
beach, Mike leading the way to a ring of driftwood
logs that had obviously been used for parties like ours
before. There was a fire circle already in place, filled
with black ashes. Eric and the boy I thought was
named Ben gathered broken branches of driftwood
from the drier piles against the forest edge, and soon
had a teepee-shaped construction built atop the old
cinders.
"Have you ever seen a driftwood fire?" Mike asked me.
I was sitting on one of the bone-colored benches; the
other girls clustered, gossiping excitedly, on either
side of me. Mike kneeled by the fire, lighting one of
the smaller sticks with a cigarette lighter.
"No," I said as he placed the blazing twig carefully
against the teepee.
"You'll like this then — watch the colors." He lit
another small branch and laid it alongside the first.
The flames started to lick quickly up the dry wood.
"It's blue," I said in surprise.
124 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"The salt does it. Pretty, isn't it?" He lit one more
piece, placed it where the fire hadn't yet caught, and
then came to sit by me. Thankfully, Jess was on his
other side. She turned to him and claimed his
attention. I watched the strange blue and green
flames crackle toward the sky. After a half hour of
chatter, some of the boys wanted to hike to the
nearby tidal pools. It was a dilemma. On the one
hand, I loved the tide pools. They had fascinated me
since I was a child; they were one of the only things I
ever looked forward to when I had to come to Forks.
On the other hand, I'd also fallen into them a lot. Not
a big deal when you're seven and with your dad. It
reminded me of Edward's request — that I not fall
into the ocean.
Lauren was the one who made my decision for me.
She didn't want to hike, and she was definitely
wearing the wrong shoes for it. Most of the other girls
besides Angela and Jessica decided to stay on the
beach as well. I waited until Tyler and Eric had
committed to remaining with them before I got up
quietly to join the pro-hiking group. Mike gave me a
huge smile when he saw that I was coming.
The hike wasn't too long, though I hated to lose the
sky in the woods. The green light of the forest was
strangely at odds with the adolescent laughter, too
murky and ominous to be in harmony with the light
banter around me. I had to watch each step I took
very carefully, avoiding roots below and branches
above, and I soon fell behind. Eventually I broke
through the emerald confines of the forest and found
the rocky shore again. It was low tide, and a tidal
125 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
river flowed past us on its way to the sea. Along its
pebbled banks, shallow pools that never completely
drained were teeming with life.
I was very cautious not to lean too far over the little
ocean ponds. The others were fearless, leaping over
the rocks, perching precariously on the edges. I found
a very stable-looking rock on the fringe of one of the
largest pools and sat there cautiously, spellbound by
the natural aquarium below me. The bouquets of
brilliant anemones undulated ceaselessly in the
invisible current, twisted shells scurried about the
edges, obscuring the crabs within them, starfish
stuck motionless to the rocks and each other, while
one small black eel with white racing stripes wove
through the bright green weeds, waiting for the sea to
return. I was completely absorbed, except for one
small part of my mind that wondered what Edward
was doing now, and trying to imagine what he would
be saying if he were here with me.
Finally the boys were hungry, and I got up stiffly to
follow them back. I tried to keep up better this time
through the woods, so naturally I fell a few times. I
got some shallow scrapes on my palms, and the knees
of my jeans were stained green, but it could have
been worse.
When we got back to First Beach, the group we'd left
behind had multiplied. As we got closer we could see
the shining, straight black hair and copper skin of the
newcomers, teenagers from the reservation come to
socialize.
126 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
The food was already being passed around, and the
boys hurried to claim a share while Eric introduced
us as we each entered the driftwood circle. Angela
and I were the last to arrive, and, as Eric said our
names, I noticed a younger boy sitting on the stones
near the fire glance up at me in interest. I sat down
next to Angela, and Mike brought us sandwiches and
an array of sodas to choose from, while a boy who
looked to be the oldest of the visitors rattled off the
names of the seven others with him. All I caught was
that one of the girls was also named Jessica, and the
boy who noticed me was named Jacob.
It was relaxing to sit with Angela; she was a restful
kind of person to be around — she didn't feel the
need to fill every silence with chatter. She left me free
to think undisturbed while we ate. And I was thinking
about how disjointedly time seemed to flow in Forks,
passing in a blur at times, with single images
standing out more clearly than others. And then, at
other times, every second was significant, etched in
my mind. I knew exactly what caused the difference,
and it disturbed me. During lunch the clouds started
to advance, slinking across the blue sky, darting in
front of the sun momentarily, casting long shadows
across the beach, and blackening the waves. As they
finished eating, people started to drift away in twos
and threes. Some walked down to the edge of the
waves, trying to skip rocks across the choppy surface.
Others were gathering a second expedition to the tide
pools. Mike — with Jessica shadowing him — headed
up to the one shop in the village. Some of the local
kids went with them; others went along on the hike.
By the time they all had scattered, I was sitting alone
127 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
on my driftwood log, with Lauren and Tyler occupying
themselves by the CD player someone had thought to
bring, and three teenagers from the reservation
perched around the circle, including the boy named
Jacob and the oldest boy who had acted as
spokesperson.
A few minutes after Angela left with the hikers, Jacob
sauntered over to take her place by my side. He
looked fourteen, maybe fifteen, and had long, glossy
black hair pulled back with a rubber band at the
nape of his neck. His skin was beautiful, silky and
russet-colored; his eyes were dark, set deep above the
high planes of his cheekbones. He still had just a hint
of childish roundness left around his chin. Altogether,
a very pretty face. However, my positive opinion of his
looks was damaged by the first words out of his
mouth.
"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?"
It was like the first day of school all over again.
"Bella," I sighed.
"I'm Jacob Black." He held his hand out in a friendly
gesture. "You bought my dad's truck."
"Oh," I said, relieved, shaking his sleek hand. "You're
Billy's son. I probably should remember you."
"No, I'm the youngest of the family — you would
remember my older sisters."
"Rachel and Rebecca," I suddenly recalled. Charlie
and Billy had thrown us together a lot during my
visits, to keep us busy while they fished. We were all
128 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
too shy to make much progress as friends. Of course,
I'd kicked up enough tantrums to end the fishing
trips by the time I was eleven.
"Are they here?" I examined the girls at the ocean's
edge, wondering if I would recognize them now.
"No." Jacob shook his head. "Rachel got a scholarship
to Washington State, and Rebecca married a Samoan
surfer — she lives in Hawaii now."
"Married. Wow." I was stunned. The twins were only a
little over a year older than I was.
"So how do you like the truck?" he asked.
"I love it. It runs great."
"Yeah, but it's really slow," he laughed. "I was so
relived when Charlie bought it. My dad wouldn't let
me work on building another car when we had a
perfectly good vehicle right there."
"It's not that slow," I objected.
"Have you tried to go over sixty?"
"No," I admitted.
"Good. Don't." He grinned.
I couldn't help grinning back. "It does great in a
collision," I offered in my truck's defense.
"I don't think a tank could take out that old monster,"
he agreed with another laugh.
"So you build cars?" I asked, impressed.
129 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"When I have free time, and parts. You wouldn't
happen to know where I could get my hands on a
master cylinder for a 1986 Volkswagen Rabbit?" he
added jokingly. He had a pleasant, husky voice.
"Sorry," I laughed, "I haven't seen any lately, but I'll
keep my eyes open for you." As if I knew what that
was. He was very easy to talk with. He flashed a
brilliant smile, looking at me appreciatively in a way I
was learning to recognize. I wasn't the only one who
noticed.
"You know Bella, Jacob?" Lauren asked — in what I
imagined was an insolent tone — from across the fire.
"We've sort of known each other since I was born," he
laughed, smiling at me again.
"How nice." She didn't sound like she thought it was
nice at all, and her pale, fishy eyes narrowed.
"Bella," she called again, watching my face carefully,
"I was just saying to Tyler that it was too bad none of
the Cullens could come out today. Didn't anyone
think to invite them?" Her expression of concern was
unconvincing.
"You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen's family?" the tall, older
boy asked before I could respond, much to Lauren's
irritation. He was really closer to a man than a boy,
and his voice was very deep.
"Yes, do you know them?" she asked condescendingly,
turning halfway toward him.
"The Cullens don't come here," he said in a tone that
closed the subject, ignoring her question.
130 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked
Lauren's opinion on a CD
he held. She was distracted.
I stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he
was looking away toward the dark forest behind us.
He'd said that the Cullens didn't come here, but his
tone had implied something more — that they weren't
allowed; they were prohibited. His manner left a
strange impression on me, and I tried to ignore it
without success.
Jacob interrupted my meditation. "So is Forks driving
you insane yet?"
"Oh, I'd say that's an understatement." I grimaced. He
grinned understandingly.
I was still turning over the brief comment on the
Cullens, and I had a sudden inspiration. It was a
stupid plan, but I didn't have any better ideas. I
hoped that young Jacob was as yet inexperienced
around girls, so that he wouldn't see through my
sure-to-be-pitiful attempts at flirting.
"Do you want to walk down the beach with me?" I
asked, trying to imitate that way Edward had of
looking up from underneath his eyelashes. It couldn't
have nearly the same effect, I was sure, but Jacob
jumped up willingly enough.
As we walked north across the multihued stones
toward the driftwood seawall, the clouds finally closed
ranks across the sky, causing the sea to darken and
131 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
the temperature to drop. I shoved my hands deep into
the pockets of my jacket.
"So you're, what, sixteen?" I asked, trying not to look
like an idiot as I fluttered my eyelids the way I'd seen
girls do on TV.
"I just turned fifteen," he confessed, flattered.
"Really?" My face was full of false surprise. "I would
have thought you were older."
"I'm tall for my age," he explained.
"Do you come up to Forks much?" I asked archly, as
if I was hoping for a yes. I sounded idiotic to myself. I
was afraid he would turn on me with disgust and
accuse me of my fraud, but he still seemed flattered.
"Not too much," he admitted with a frown. "But when
I get my car finished I can go up as much as I want —
after I get my license," he amended.
"Who was that other boy Lauren was talking to? He
seemed a little old to be hanging out with us." I
purposefully lumped myself in with the youngsters,
trying to make it clear that I preferred Jacob.
"That's Sam — he's nineteen," he informed me.
"What was that he was saying about the doctor's
family?" I asked innocently.
"The Cullens? Oh, they're not supposed to come onto
the reservation." He looked away, out toward James
Island, as he confirmed what I'd thought I'd heard in
Sam's voice.
132 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Why not?"
He glanced back at me, biting his lip. "Oops. I'm not
supposed to say anything about that."
"Oh, I won't tell anyone, I'm just curious." I tried to
make my smile alluring, wondering if I was laying it
on too thick.
He smiled back, though, looking allured. Then he
lifted one eyebrow and his voice was even huskier
than before.
"Do you like scary stories?" he asked ominously.
"I love them," I enthused, making an effort to smolder
at him. Jacob strolled to a nearby driftwood tree that
had its roots sticking out like the attenuated legs of a
huge, pale spider. He perched lightly on one of the
twisted roots while I sat beneath him on the body of
the tree. He stared down at the rocks, a smile
hovering around the edges of his broad lips. I could
see he was going to try to make this good. I focused
on keeping the vital interest I felt out of my eyes.
"Do you know any of our old stories, about where we
came from — the Quileutes, I mean?" he began.
"Not really," I admitted.
"Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming
to date back to the Flood — supposedly, the ancient
Quileutes tied their canoes to the tops of the tallest
trees on the mountain to survive like Noah and the
ark." He smiled, to show me how little stock he put in
the histories.
133 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Another legend claims that we descended from
wolves — and that the wolves are our brothers still.
It's against tribal law to kill them.
"Then there are the stories about the cold ones." His
voice dropped a little lower.
"The cold ones?" I asked, not faking my intrigue now.
"Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the
wolf legends, and some much more recent. According
to legend, my own great-grandfather knew some of
them. He was the one who made the treaty that kept
them off our land." He rolled his eyes.
"Your great-grandfather?" I encouraged.
"He was a tribal elder, like my father. You see, the
cold ones are the natural enemies of the wolf—well,
not the wolf, really, but the wolves that turn into
men, like our ancestors. You would call them
werewolves."
"Werewolves have enemies?"
"Only one."
I stared at him earnestly, hoping to disguise my
impatience as admiration.
"So you see," Jacob continued, "the cold ones are
traditionally our enemies. But this pack that came to
our territory during my great-grandfather's time was
different. They didn't hunt the way others of their
kind did — they weren't supposed to be dangerous to
the tribe. So my great-grandfather made a truce with
them. If they would promise to stay off our lands, we
134 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
wouldn't expose them to the pale-faces." He winked at
me.
"If they weren't dangerous, then why… ?" I tried to
understand, struggling not to let him see how
seriously I was considering his ghost story.
"There's always a risk for humans to be around the
cold ones, even if they're civilized like this clan was.
You never know when they might get too hungry to
resist." He deliberately worked a thick edge of menace
into his tone.
"What do you mean, 'civilized'?"
"They claimed that they didn't hunt humans. They
supposedly were somehow able to prey on animals
instead."
I tried to keep my voice casual. "So how does it fit in
with the Cullens?
Are they like the cold ones your greatgrandfather
met?"
"No." He paused dramatically. "They are the same
ones." He must have thought the expression on my
face was fear inspired by his story. He smiled,
pleased, and continued.
"There are more of them now, a new female and a new
male, but the rest are the same. In my greatgrandfather's time they already knew of the leader,
Carlisle. He'd been here and gone before your people
had even arrived." He was fighting a smile.
135 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"And what are they?" I finally asked. "What are the
cold ones?" He smiled darkly.
"Blood drinkers," he replied in a chilling voice. "Your
people call them vampires."
I stared out at the rough surf after he answered, not
sure what my face was exposing.
"You have goose bumps," he laughed delightedly.
"You're a good storyteller," I complimented him, still
staring into the waves.
"Pretty crazy stuff, though, isn't it? No wonder my dad
doesn't want us to talk about it to anyone."
I couldn't control my expression enough to look at
him yet. "Don't worry, I won't give you away."
"I guess I just violated the treaty," he laughed.
"I'll take it to the grave," I promised, and then I
shivered.
"Seriously, though, don't say anything to Charlie. He
was pretty mad at my dad when he heard that some
of us weren't going to the hospital since Dr. Cullen
started working there."
"I won't, of course not."
"So do you think we're a bunch of superstitious
natives or what?" he asked in a playful tone, but with
a hint of worry. I still hadn't looked away from the
ocean.
I turned and smiled at him as normally as I could.
136 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"No. I think you're very good at telling scary stories,
though. I still have goose bumps, see?" I held up my
arm.
"Cool." He smiled.
And then the sound of the beach rocks clattering
against each other warned us that someone was
approaching. Our heads snapped up at the same time
to see Mike and Jessica about fifty yards away,
walking toward us.
"There you are, Bella," Mike called in relief, waving his
arm over his head.
"Is that your boyfriend?" Jacob asked, alerted by the
jealous edge in Mike's voice. I was surprised it was so
obvious.
"No, definitely not," I whispered. I was tremendously
grateful to Jacob, and eager to make him as happy as
possible. I winked at him, carefully turning away from
Mike to do so. He smiled, elated by my inept flirting.
"So when I get my license…" he began.
"You should come see me in Forks. We could hang
out sometime." I felt guilty as I said this, knowing that
I'd used him. But I really did like Jacob. He was
someone I could easily be friends with.
Mike had reached us now, with Jessica still a few
paces back. I could see his eyes appraising Jacob,
and looking satisfied at his obvious youth.
"Where have you been?" he asked, though the answer
was right in front of him.
137 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Jacob was just telling me some local stories," I
volunteered. "It was really interesting."
I smiled at Jacob warmly, and he grinned back.
"Well," Mike paused, carefully reassessing the
situation as he watched our camaraderie. "We're
packing up — it looks like it's going to rain soon."
We all looked up at the glowering sky. It certainly did
look like rain.
"Okay." I jumped up. "I'm coming."
"It was nice to see you again," Jacob said, and I could
tell he was taunting Mike just a bit.
"It really was. Next time Charlie comes down to see
Billy, I'll come, too," I promised.
His grin stretched across his face. "That would be
cool."
"And thanks," I added earnestly.
I pulled up my hood as we tramped across the rocks
toward the parking lot. A few drops were beginning to
fall, making black spots on the stones where they
landed. When we got to the Suburban the others were
already loading everything back in. I crawled into the
backseat by Angela and Tyler, announcing that I'd
already had my turn in the shotgun position. Angela
just stared out the window at the escalating storm,
and Lauren twisted around in the middle seat to
occupy Tyler's attention, so I could simply lay my
head back on the seat and close my eyes and try very
hard not to think.
138 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
NIGHTMARE
I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I
didn't want anything to eat. There was a basketball
game on that he was excited about, though of course I
had no idea what was special about it, so he wasn't
aware of anything unusual in my face or tone.
Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my
desk until I found my old headphones, and I plugged
them into my little CD player. I picked up a CD that
Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was one of his
favorite bands, but they used a little too much bass
and shrieking for my tastes. I popped it into place and
lay down on my bed. I put on the headphones, hit
Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt my ears.
I closed my eyes, but the light still intruded, so I
added a pillow over the top half of my face.
I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to
understand the lyrics, to unravel the complicated
drum patterns. By the third time I'd listened through
the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at least.
I was surprised to find that I really did like the band
after all, once I got past the blaring noise. I'd have to
thank Phil again. And it worked. The shattering beats
made it impossible for me to think —
which was the whole purpose of the exercise. I
listened to the CD again and again, until I was
singing along with all the songs, until, finally, I fell
asleep.
139 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some
corner of my consciousness that I was dreaming, I
recognized the green light of the forest. I could hear
the waves crashing against the rocks somewhere
nearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be
able to see the sun. I was trying to follow the sound,
but then Jacob Black was there, tugging on my hand,
pulling me back toward the blackest part of the
forest.
"Jacob? What's wrong?" I asked. His face was
frightened as he yanked with all his strength against
my resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark.
"Run, Bella, you have to run!" he whispered, terrified.
"This way, Bella!" I recognized Mike's voice calling out
of the gloomy heart of the trees, but I couldn't see
him.
"Why?" I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp,
desperate now to find the sun.
But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly
shaking, falling to the dim forest floor. He twitched on
the ground as I watched in horror.
"Jacob!" I screamed. But he was gone. In his place
was a large red-brown wolf with black eyes. The wolf
faced away from me, pointing toward the shore, the
hair on the back of his shoulders bristling, low growls
issuing from between his exposed fangs.
"Bella, run!" Mike cried out again from behind me.
But I didn't turn. I was watching a light coming
toward me from the beach.
140 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his skin
faintly glowing, his eyes black and dangerous. He
held up one hand and beckoned me to come to him.
The wolf growled at my feet.
I took a step forward, toward Edward. He smiled then,
and his teeth were sharp, pointed.
"Trust me," he purred.
I took another step.
The wolf launched himself across the space between
me and the vampire, fangs aiming for the jugular.
"No!" I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed.
My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull
the CD player off the bedside table, and it clattered to
the wooden floor.
My light was still on, and I was sitting fully dressed
on the bed, with my shoes on. I glanced, disoriented,
at the clock on my dresser. It was five-thirty in the
morning.
I groaned, fell back, and rolled over onto my face,
kicking off my boots. I was too uncomfortable to get
anywhere near sleep, though. I rolled back over and
unbuttoned my jeans, yanking them off awkwardly as
I tried to stay horizontal. I could feel the braid in my
hair, an uncomfortable ridge along the back of my
skull. I turned onto my side and ripped the rubber
band out, quickly combing through the plaits with my
fingers. I pulled the pillow back over my eyes.
It was all no use, of course. My subconscious had
dredged up exactly the images I'd been trying so
141 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
desperately to avoid. I was going to have to face them
now.
I sat up, and my head spun for a minute as the blood
flowed downward. First things first, I thought to
myself, happy to put it off as long as possible. I
grabbed my bathroom bag.
The shower didn't last nearly as long as I hoped it
would, though. Even taking the time to blow-dry my
hair, I was soon out of things to do in the bathroom.
Wrapped in a towel, I crossed back to my room. I
couldn't tell if Charlie was still asleep, or if he had
already left. I went to look out my window, and the
cruiser was gone. Fishing again. I dressed slowly in
my most comfy sweats and then made my bed —
something I never did. I couldn't put it off any longer.
I went to my desk and switched on my old computer.
I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly
outdated, my free service substandard; just dialing up
took so long that I decided to go get myself a bowl of
cereal while I waited.
I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was
done, I washed the bowl and spoon, dried them, and
put them away. My feet dragged as I climbed the
stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up off
the floor and placing it precisely in the center of the
table. I pulled out the headphones, and put them
away in the desk drawer. Then I turned the same CD
on, turning it down to the point where it was
background noise. With another sigh, I turned to my
computer. Naturally, the screen was covered in popup ads. I sat in my hard folding chair and began
142 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
closing all the little windows. Eventually I made it to
my favorite search engine. I shot down a few more
pop-ups and then typed in one word. Vampire.
It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the
results came up, there was a lot to sift through —
everything from movies and TV shows to role-playing
games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic
companies. Then I found a promising site — Vampires
A—Z. I waited impatiently for it to load, quickly
clicking closed each ad that flashed across the screen.
Finally the screen was finished — simple white
background with black text, academic-looking. Two
quotes greeted me on the home page: Throughout the
vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no
figure so terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred,
yet dight with such fearful fascination, as the
vampire, who is himself neither ghost nor demon, but
yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the
mysterious and terrible qualities of both. — Rev.
Montague Summers
If there is in this world a well-attested account, it is
that of the vampires. Nothing is lacking: official
reports, affidavits of well-known people, of surgeons,
of priests, of magistrates; the judicial proof is most
complete. And with all that, who is there who believes
in vampires?
— Rousseau
The rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all
the different myths of vampires held throughout the
world. The first I clicked on, the Danag, was a Filipino
vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro on
143 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
the islands long ago. The myth continued that the
Danag worked with humans for many years, but the
partnership ended one day when a woman cut her
finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the
taste so much that it drained her body completely of
blood.
I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for
anything that sounded familiar, let alone plausible. It
seemed that most vampire myths centered around
beautiful women as demons and children as victims;
they also seemed like constructs created to explain
away the high mortality rates for young children, and
to give men an excuse for infidelity. Many of the
stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against
improper burials. There wasn't much that sounded
like the movies I'd seen, and only a very few, like the
Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who were even
preoccupied with drinking blood.
Only three entries really caught my attention: the
Romanian Varacolaci, a powerful undead being who
could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinned human, the
Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it could
massacre an entire village in the single hour after
midnight, and one other, the Stregoni benefici.
About this last there was only one brief sentence.
Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on
the side of goodness, and a mortal enemy of all evil
vampires.
It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth
among hundreds that claimed the existence of good
vampires.
144 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
Overall, though, there was little that coincided with
Jacob's stories or my own observations. I'd made a
little catalogue in my mind as I'd read and carefully
compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty,
pale skin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's
criteria: blood drinkers, enemies of the werewolf, coldskinned, and immortal. There were very few myths
that matched even one factor.
And then another problem, one that I'd remembered
from the small number of scary movies that I'd seen
and was backed up by today's reading —
vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun
would burn them to a cinder. They slept in coffins all
day and came out only at night. Aggravated, I
snapped off the computer's main power switch, not
waiting to shut things down properly. Through my
irritation, I felt overwhelming embarrassment. It was
all so stupid. I was sitting in my room, researching
vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that
most of the blame belonged on the doorstep of the
town of Forks — and the entire sodden Olympic
Peninsula, for that matter.
I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I
wanted to go that didn't involve a three-day drive. I
pulled on my boots anyway, unclear where I was
headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my
raincoat without checking the weather and stomped
out the door.
It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my
truck and started east on foot, angling across
Charlie's yard toward the ever-encroaching forest. It
145 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house
and the road to be invisible, for the only sound to be
the squish of the damp earth under my feet and the
sudden cries of the jays.
There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the
forest here, or I wouldn't risk wandering on my own
like this. My sense of direction was hopeless; I could
get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trail
wound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east
as far as I could tell. It snaked around the Sitka
spruces and the hemlocks, the yews and the maples. I
only vaguely knew the names of the trees around me,
and all I knew was due to Charlie pointing them out
to me from the cruiser window in earlier days. There
were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't be
sure about because they were so covered in green
parasites. I followed the trail as long as my anger at
myself pushed me forward. As that started to ebb, I
slowed. A few drops of moisture trickled down from
the canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it
was beginning to rain or if it was simply pools left
over from yesterday, held high in the leaves above me,
slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recently
fallen tree — I knew it was recent because it wasn't
entirely carpeted in moss — rested against the trunk
of one of her sisters, creating a sheltered little bench
just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped over the
ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket was
between the damp seat and my clothes wherever they
touched, and leaned my hooded head back against
the living tree.
146 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
This was the wrong place to have come. I should have
known, but where else was there to go? The forest
was deep green and far too much like the scene in
last night's dream to allow for peace of mind. Now
that there was no longer the sound of my soggy
footsteps, the silence was piercing. The birds were
quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it
must be raining above. The ferns stood higher than
my head, now that I was seated, and I knew someone
could walk by on the path, three feet away, and not
see me.
Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the
absurdities that embarrassed me indoors. Nothing
had changed in this forest for thousands of years, and
all the myths and legends of a hundred different
lands seemed much more likely in this green haze
than they had in my clear-cut bedroom.
I forced myself to focus on the two most vital
questions I had to answer, but I did so unwillingly.
First, I had to decide if it was possible that what
Jacob had said about the Cullens could be true.
Immediately my mind responded with a resounding
negative. It was silly and morbid to entertain such
ridiculous notions. But what, then? I asked myself.
There was no rational explanation for how I was alive
at this moment. I listed again in my head the things
I'd observed myself: the impossible speed and
strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold and
back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid skin.
And more —
147 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
small things that registered slowly — how they never
seemed to eat, the disturbing grace with which they
moved. And the way be
sometimes spoke, with unfamiliar cadences and
phrases that better fit the style of a turn-of-thecentury novel than that of a twenty-first-century
classroom. He had skipped class the day we'd done
blood typing. He hadn't said no to the beach trip till
he heard where we were going. He seemed to know
what everyone around him was thinking… except me.
He had told me he was the villain, dangerous…
Could the Cullens be vampires?
Well, they were something. Something outside the
possibility of rational justification was taking place in
front of my incredulous eyes. Whether it be Jacob's
cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward
Cullen was not… human. He was something more.
So then — maybe. That would have to be my answer
for now. And then the most important question of all.
What was I going to do if it was true?
If Edward was a vampire — I could hardly make
myself think the words —
then what should I do? Involving someone else was
definitely out. I couldn't even believe myself; anyone I
told would have me committed. Only two options
seemed practical. The first was to take his advice: to
be smart, to avoid him as much as possible. To cancel
our plans, to go back to ignoring him as far as I was
able. To pretend there was an impenetrably thick
glass wall between us in the one class where we were
148 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
forced together. To tell him to leave me alone — and
mean it this time. I was gripped in a sudden agony of
despair as I considered that alternative. My mind
rejected the pain, quickly skipping on to the next
option.
I could do nothing different. After all, if he was
something… sinister, he'd done nothing to hurt me so
far. In fact, I would be a dent in Tyler's fender if he
hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued with
myself, that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it
was a reflex to save lives, how bad could he be? I
retorted. My head spun around in answerless circles.
There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of
anything. The dark Edward in my dream last night
was a reflection only of my fear of the word Jacob had
spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd
screamed out in terror at the werewolf's lunge, it
wasn't fear for the wolf that brought the cry of "no" to
my lips. It was fear that he would be harmed —
even as he called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I
feared for him. And I knew in that I had my answer. I
didn't know if there ever was a choice, really. I was
already in too deep. Now that I knew — if I knew —
I could do nothing about my frightening secret.
Because when I thought of him, of his voice, his
hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of his personality, I
wanted nothing more than to be with him right now.
Even if… but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the
darkening forest. Not while the rain made it dim as
twilight under the canopy and pattered like footsteps
across the matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose
149 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
quickly from my place of concealment, worried that
somehow the path would have disappeared with the
rain.
But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out
of the dripping green maze. I followed it hastily, my
hood pulled close around my face, becoming
surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how
far I had come. I started to wonder if I was heading
out at all, or following the path farther into the
confines of the forest. Before I could get too panicky,
though, I began to glimpse some open spaces through
the webbed branches. And then I could hear a car
passing on the street, and I was free, Charlie's lawn
stretched out in front of me, the house beckoning me,
promising warmth and dry socks.
It was just noon when I got back inside. I went
upstairs and got dressed for the day, jeans and a tshirt, since I was staying indoors. It didn't take too
much effort to concentrate on my task for the day, a
paper on Macbeth that was due Wednesday. I settled
into outlining a rough draft contentedly, more serene
than I'd felt since… well, since Thursday afternoon, if
I was being honest.
That had always been my way, though. Making
decisions was the painful part for me, the part I
agonized over. But once the decision was made, I
simply followed through — usually with relief that the
choice was made. Sometimes the relief was tainted by
despair, like my decision to come to Forks. But it was
still better than wrestling with the alternatives. This
decision was ridiculously easy to live with.
Dangerously easy. And so the day was quiet,
150 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
productive — I finished my paper before eight. Charlie
came home with a large catch, and I made a mental
note to pick up a book of recipes for fish while I was
in Seattle next week. The chills that flashed up my
spine whenever I thought of that trip were no different
than the ones I'd felt before I'd taken my walk with
Jacob Black. They should be different, I thought. I
should be afraid — I knew I should be, but I couldn't
feel the right kind of fear.
I slept dreamlessly that night, exhausted from
beginning my day so early, and sleeping so poorly the
night before. I woke, for the second time since
arriving in Forks, to the bright yellow light of a sunny
day. I skipped to the window, stunned to see that
there was hardly a cloud in the sky, and those there
were just fleecy little white puffs that couldn't
possibly be carrying any rain. I opened the window —
surprised when it opened silently, without sticking,
not having opened it in who knows how many years
— and sucked in the relatively dry air. It was nearly
warm and hardly windy at all. My blood was electric
in my veins. Charlie was finishing breakfast when I
came downstairs, and he picked up on my mood
immediately.
"Nice day out," he commented.
"Yes," I agreed with a grin.
He smiled back, his brown eyes crinkling around the
edges. When Charlie smiled, it was easier to see why
he and my mother had jumped too quickly into an
early marriage. Most of the young romantic he'd been
in those days had faded before I'd known him, as the
151 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
curly brown hair — the same color, if not the same
texture, as mine — had dwindled, slowly revealing
more and more of the shiny skin of his forehead. But
when he smiled I could see a little of the man who
had run away with Renée when she was just two
years older than I was now.
I ate breakfast cheerily, watching the dust moats
stirring in the sunlight that streamed in the back
window. Charlie called out a goodbye, and I heard the
cruiser pull away from the house. I hesitated on my
way out the door, hand on my rain jacket. It would be
tempting fate to leave it home. With a sigh, I folded it
over my arm and stepped out into the brightest light
I'd seen in months.
By dint of much elbow grease, I was able to get both
windows in the truck almost completely rolled down. I
was one of the first ones to school; I hadn't even
checked the clock in my hurry to get outside. I parked
and headed toward the seldom-used picnic benches
on the south side of the cafeteria. The benches were
still a little damp, so I sat on my jacket, glad to have a
use for it. My homework was done — the product of a
slow social life — but there were a few Trig problems I
wasn't sure I had right. I took out my book
industriously, but halfway through rechecking the
first problem I was daydreaming, watching the
sunlight play on the red-barked trees. I sketched
inattentively along the margins of my homework. After
a few minutes, I suddenly realized I'd drawn five pairs
of dark eyes staring out of the page at me. I scrubbed
them out with the eraser.
152 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Bella!" I heard someone call, and it sounded like
Mike. I looked around to realize that the school had
become populated while I'd been sitting there,
absentminded. Everyone was in t-shirts, some even in
shorts though the temperature couldn't be over sixty.
Mike was coming toward me in khaki shorts and a
striped Rugby shirt, waving.
"Hey, Mike," I called, waving back, unable to be
halfhearted on a morning like this.
He came to sit by me, the tidy spikes of his hair
shining golden in the light, his grin stretching across
his face. He was so delighted to see me, I couldn't
help but feel gratified.
"I never noticed before — your hair has red in it," he
commented, catching between his fingers a strand
that was fluttering in the light breeze.
"Only in the sun."
I became just a little uncomfortable as he tucked the
lock behind my ear.
"Great day, isn't it?"
"My kind of day," I agreed.
"What did you do yesterday?" His tone was just a bit
too proprietary.
"I mostly worked on my essay." I didn't add that I was
finished with it —
no need to sound smug.
153 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
He hit his forehead with the heel of his hand. "Oh
yeah — that's due Thursday, right?"
"Um, Wednesday, I think."
"Wednesday?" He frowned. "That's not good… What
are you writing yours on?"
"Whether Shakespeare's treatment of the female
characters is misogynistic."
He stared at me like I'd just spoken in pig Latin.
"I guess I'll have to get to work on that tonight," he
said, deflated. "I was going to ask if you wanted to go
out."
"Oh." I was taken off guard. Why couldn't I ever have
a pleasant conversation with Mike anymore without it
getting awkward?
"Well, we could go to dinner or something… and I
could work on it later." He smiled at me hopefully.
"Mike…" I hated being put on the spot. "I don't think
that would be the best idea."
His face fell. "Why?" he asked, his eyes guarded. My
thoughts flickered to Edward, wondering if that's
where his thoughts were as well.
"I think… and if you ever repeat what I'm saying right
now I will cheerfully beat you to death," I threatened,
"but I think that would hurt Jessica's feelings."
He was bewildered, obviously not thinking in that
direction at all.
154 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Jessica?"
"Really, Mike, are you blind?"
"Oh," he exhaled — clearly dazed. I took advantage of
that to make my escape.
"It's time for class, and I can't be late again." I
gathered my books up and stuffed them in my bag.
We walked in silence to building three, and his
expression was distracted. I hoped whatever thoughts
he was immersed in were leading him in the right
direction.
When I saw Jessica in Trig, she was bubbling with
enthusiasm. She, Angela, and Lauren were going to
Port Angeles tonight to go dress shopping for the
dance, and she wanted me to come, too, even though
I didn't need one. I was indecisive. It would be nice to
get out of town with some girlfriends, but Lauren
would be there. And who knew what I could be doing
tonight… But that was definitely the wrong path to let
my mind wander down. Of course I was happy about
the sunlight. But that wasn't completely responsible
for the euphoric mood I was in, not even close.
So I gave her a maybe, telling her I'd have to talk with
Charlie first. She talked of nothing but the dance on
the way to Spanish, continuing as if without an
interruption when class finally ended, five minutes
late, and we were on our way to lunch. I was far too
lost in my own frenzy of anticipation to notice much
of what she said. I was painfully eager to see not just
him but all the Cullens — to compare them with the
new suspicions that plagued my mind. As I crossed
155 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
the threshold of the cafeteria, I felt the first true tingle
of fear slither down my spine and settle in my
stomach. Would they be able to know what I was
thinking? And then a different feeling jolted through
me — would Edward be waiting to sit with me again?
As was my routine, I glanced first toward the Cullens'
table. A shiver of panic trembled in my stomach as I
realized it was empty. With dwindling hope, my eyes
scoured the rest of the cafeteria, hoping to find him
alone, waiting for me. The place was nearly filled —
Spanish had made us late — but there was no sign of
Edward or any of his family. Desolation hit me with
crippling strength.
I shambled along behind Jessica, not bothering to
pretend to listen anymore.
We were late enough that everyone was already at our
table. I avoided the empty chair next to Mike in favor
of one by Angela. I vaguely noticed that Mike held the
chair out politely for Jessica, and that her face lit up
in response.
Angela asked a few quiet questions about the
Macbeth paper, which I answered as naturally as I
could while spiraling downward in misery. She, too,
invited me to go with them tonight, and I agreed now,
grasping at anything to distract myself.
I realized I'd been holding on to a last shred of hope
when I entered Biology, saw his empty seat, and felt a
new wave of disappointment. The rest of the day
passed slowly, dismally. In Gym, we had a lecture on
the rules of badminton, the next torture they had
lined up for me. But at least it meant I got to sit and
156 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
listen instead of stumbling around on the court. The
best part was the coach didn't finish, so I got another
day off tomorrow. Never mind that the day after they
would arm me with a racket before unleashing me on
the rest of the class.
I was glad to leave campus, so I would be free to pout
and mope before I went out tonight with Jessica and
company. But right after I walked in the door of
Charlie's house, Jessica called to cancel our plans. I
tried to be happy that Mike had asked her out to
dinner — I really was relieved that he finally seemed
to be catching on — but my enthusiasm sounded
false in my own ears. She rescheduled our shopping
trip for tomorrow night.
Which left me with little in the way of distractions. I
had fish marinating for dinner, with a salad and
bread left over from the night before, so there was
nothing to do there. I spent a focused half hour on
homework, but then I was through with that, too. I
checked my e-mail, reading the backlog of letters from
my mother, getting snippier as they progressed to the
present. I sighed and typed a quick response. Mom,
Sorry. I've been out. I went to the beach with some
friends. And I had to write a paper.
My excuses were fairly pathetic, so I gave up on that.
It's sunny outside today - I know, I'm shocked, too -
so I'm going to go outside and soak up as much
vitamin D as I can. I love you, Bella.
I decided to kill an hour with non-school-related
reading. I had a small collection of books that came
157 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
with me to Forks, the shabbiest volume being a
compilation of the works of Jane Austen. I selected
that one and headed to the backyard, grabbing a
ragged old quilt from the linen cupboard at the top of
the stairs on my way down.
Outside in Charlie's small, square yard, I folded the
quilt in half and laid it out of the reach of the trees'
shadows on the thick lawn that would always be
slightly wet, no matter how long the sun shone. I lay
on my stomach, crossing my ankles in the air,
flipping through the different novels in the book,
trying to decide which would occupy my mind the
most thoroughly. My favorites were Pride and
Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. I'd read the first
most recently, so I started into Sense and Sensibility,
only to remember after I began three that the hero of
the story happened to be named Edward. Angrily, I
turned to Mansfield Park, but the hero of that piece
was named Edmund, and that was just too close.
Weren't there any other names available in the late
eighteenth century? I snapped the book shut,
annoyed, and rolled over onto my back. I pushed my
sleeves up as high as they would go, and closed my
eyes. I would think of nothing but the warmth on my
skin, I told myself severely. The breeze was still light,
but it blew tendrils of my hair around my face, and
that tickled a bit. I pulled all my hair over my head,
letting it fan out on the quilt above me, and focused
again on the heat that touched my eyelids, my
cheekbones, my nose, my lips, my forearms, my neck,
soaked through my light shirt…
158 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
The next thing I was conscious of was the sound of
Charlie's cruiser turning onto the bricks of the
driveway. I sat up in surprise, realizing the light was
gone, behind the trees, and I had fallen asleep. I
looked around, muddled, with the sudden feeling that
I wasn't alone.
"Charlie?" I asked. But I could hear his door
slamming in front of the house.
I jumped up, foolishly edgy, gathering the now-damp
quilt and my book. I ran inside to get some oil heating
on the stove, realizing that dinner would be late.
Charlie was hanging up his gun belt and stepping out
of his boots when I came in.
"Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet — I fell asleep
outside." I stifled a yawn.
"Don't worry about it," he said. "I wanted to catch the
score on the game, anyway."
I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something
to do. There wasn't anything on I wanted to watch,
but he knew I didn't like baseball, so he turned it to
some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He
seemed happy, though, to be doing something
together. And it felt good, despite my depression, to
make him happy.
"Dad," I said during a commercial, "Jessica and
Angela are going to look at dresses for the dance
tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted me
to help them choose… do you mind if I go with them?"
"Jessica Stanley?" he asked.
159 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"And Angela Weber." I sighed as I gave him the
details. He was confused. "But you're not going to the
dance, right?"
"No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses — you
know, giving them constructive criticism." I wouldn't
have to explain this to a woman.
"Well, okay." He seemed to realize that he was out of
his depth with the girlie stuff. "It's a school night,
though."
"We'll leave right after school, so we can get back
early. You'll be okay for dinner, right?"
"Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got
here," he reminded me.
"I don't know how you survived," I muttered, then
added more clearly,
"I'll leave some things for cold-cut sandwiches in the
fridge, okay?
Right on top."
It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with
renewed hope that I grimly tried to suppress. I
dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blue V-neck
blouse — something I'd worn in the dead of winter in
Phoenix. I had planned my arrival at school so that I
barely had time to make it to class. With a sinking
heart, I circled the full lot looking for a space, while
also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly not
there. I parked in the last row and hurried to English,
arriving breathless, but subdued, before the final bell.
160 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
It was the same as yesterday — I just couldn't keep
little sprouts of hope from budding in my mind, only
to have them squashed painfully as I searched the
lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table.
The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for
tonight and made all the more attractive by the fact
that Lauren had other obligations. I was anxious to
get out of town so I could stop glancing over my
shoulder, hoping to see him appearing out of the blue
the way he always did. I vowed to myself that I would
be in a good mood tonight and not ruin Angela's or
Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I
could do a little clothes shopping as well. I refused to
think that I might be shopping alone in Seattle this
weekend, no longer interested in the earlier
arrangement. Surely he wouldn't cancel without at
least telling me.
After school, Jessica followed me home in her old
white Mercury so that I could ditch my books and
truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when I was
inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I
contemplated getting out of Forks. I left a note for
Charlie on the table, explaining again where to find
dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school
bag to a purse I rarely used, and ran out to join
Jessica. We went to Angela's house next, and she was
waiting for us. My excitement increased exponentially
as we actually drove out of the town limits.

161 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
PORT ANGELES
Jess drove faster than the Chief, so we made it to Port
Angeles by four. It had been a while since I'd had a
girls' night out, and the estrogen rush was
invigorating. We listened to whiny rock songs while
Jessica jabbered on about the boys we hung out with.
Jessica's dinner with Mike had gone very well, and
she was hoping that by Saturday night they would
have progressed to the first-kiss stage. I smiled to
myself, pleased. Angela was passively happy to be
going to the dance, but not really interested in Eric.
Jess tried to get her to confess who her type was, but
I interrupted with a question about dresses after a
bit, to spare her. Angela threw a grateful glance my
way.
Port Angeles was a beautiful little tourist trap, much
more polished and quaint than Forks. But Jessica
and Angela knew it well, so they didn't plan to waste
time on the picturesque boardwalk by the bay. Jess
drove straight to the one big department store in
town, which was a few streets in from the bay area's
visitor-friendly face.
The dance was billed as semiformal, and we weren't
exactly sure what that meant. Both Jessica and
Angela seemed surprised and almost disbelieving
when I told them I'd never been to a dance in
Phoenix.
162 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Didn't you ever go with a boyfriend or something?"
Jess asked dubiously as we walked through the front
doors of the store.
"Really," I tried to convince her, not wanting to
confess my dancing problems. "I've never had a
boyfriend or anything close. I didn't go out much."
"Why not?" Jessica demanded.
"No one asked me," I answered honestly.
She looked skeptical. "People ask you out here," she
reminded me, "and you tell them no." We were in the
juniors' section now, scanning the racks for dress-up
clothes.
"Well, except for Tyler," Angela amended quietly.
"Excuse me?" I gasped. "What did you say?"
"Tyler told everyone he's taking you to prom," Jessica
informed me with suspicious eyes.
"He said what?" I sounded like I was choking.
"I told you it wasn't true," Angela murmured to
Jessica. I was silent, still lost in shock that was
quickly turning to irritation. But we had found the
dress racks, and now we had work to do.
"That's why Lauren doesn't like you," Jessica giggled
while we pawed through the clothes.
I ground my teeth. "Do you think that if I ran him
over with my truck he would stop feeling guilty about
the accident? That he might give up on making
amends and call it even?"
163 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Maybe," Jess snickered. '"If that's why he's doing
this." The dress selection wasn't large, but both of
them found a few things to try on. I sat on a low chair
just inside the dressing room, by the three-way
mirror, trying to control my fuming.
Jess was torn between two — one a long, strapless,
basic black number, the other a knee-length electric
blue with spaghetti straps. I encouraged her to go
with the blue; why not play up the eyes? Angela chose
a pale pink dress that draped around her tall frame
nicely and brought out honey tints in her light brown
hair. I complimented them both generously and
helped by returning the rejects to their racks. The
whole process was much shorter and easier than
similar trips I'd taken with Renée at home. I guess
there was something to be said for limited choices. We
headed over to shoes and accessories. While they
tried things on I merely watched and critiqued, not in
the mood to shop for myself, though I did need new
shoes. The girls'-night high was wearing off in the
wake of my annoyance at Tyler, leaving room for the
gloom to move back in.
"Angela?" I began, hesitant, while she was trying on a
pair of pink strappy heels — she was overjoyed to
have a date tall enough that she could wear high
heels at all.
Jessica had drifted to the jewelry counter and we
were alone.
"Yes?" She held her leg out, twisting her ankle to get a
better view of the shoe.
I chickened out. "I like those."
164 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"I think I'll get them — though they'll never match
anything but the one dress," she mused.
"Oh, go ahead — they're on sale," I encouraged. She
smiled, putting the lid back on a box that contained
more practical-looking off-white shoes. I tried again.
"Um, Angela…" She looked up curiously.
"Is it normal for the… Cullens" — I kept my eyes on
the shoes — "to be out of school a lot?" I failed
miserably in my attempt to sound nonchalant.
"Yes, when the weather is good they go backpacking
all the time — even the doctor. They're all real
outdoorsy," she told me quietly, examining her shoes,
too. She didn't ask one question, let alone the
hundreds that Jessica would have unleashed. I was
beginning to really like Angela.
"Oh." I let the subject drop as Jessica returned to
show us the rhinestone jewelry she'd found to match
her silver shoes. We planned to go to dinner at a little
Italian restaurant on the boardwalk, but the dress
shopping hadn't taken as long as we'd expected. Jess
and Angela were going to take their clothes back to
the car and then walk down to the bay. I told them I
would meet them at the restaurant in an hour — I
wanted to look for a bookstore. They were both willing
to come with me, but I encouraged them to go have
fun — they didn't know how preoccupied I could get
when surrounded by books; it was something I
preferred to do alone. They walked off to the car
chattering happily, and I headed in the direction Jess
pointed out.
165 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
I had no trouble finding the bookstore, but it wasn't
what I was looking for. The windows were full of
crystals, dream-catchers, and books about spiritual
healing. I didn't even go inside. Through the glass I
could see a fifty-year-old woman with long, gray hair
worn straight down her back, clad in a dress right out
of the sixties, smiling welcomingly from behind the
counter. I decided that was one conversation I could
skip. There had to be a normal bookstore in town.
I meandered through the streets, which were filling
up with end-of-the-workday traffic, and hoped I was
headed toward downtown. I wasn't paying as much
attention as I should to where I was going; I was
wrestling with despair. I was trying so hard not to
think about him, and what Angela had said… and
more than anything trying to beat down my hopes for
Saturday, fearing a disappointment more painful than
the rest, when I looked up to see someone's silver
Volvo parked along the street and it all came crashing
down on me. Stupid, unreliable vampire, I thought to
myself.
I stomped along in a southerly direction, toward some
glass-fronted shops that looked promising. But when
I got to them, they were just a repair shop and a
vacant space. I still had too much time to go looking
for Jess and Angela yet, and I definitely needed to get
my mood in hand before I met back up with them. I
ran my fingers through my hair a couple of times and
took some deep breaths before I continued around the
corner. I started to realize, as I crossed another road,
that I was going the wrong direction. The little foot
traffic I had seen was going north, and it looked like
166 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
the buildings here were mostly warehouses. I decided
to turn east at the next corner, and then loop around
after a few blocks and try my luck on a different street
on my way back to the boardwalk. A group of four
men turned around the corner I was heading for,
dressed too casually to be heading home from the
office, but they were too grimy to be tourists. As they
approached me, I realized they weren't too many
years older than I was. They were joking loudly
among themselves, laughing raucously and punching
each other's arms. I scooted as far to the inside of the
sidewalk as I could to give them room, walking
swiftly, looking past them to the corner.
"Hey, there!" one of them called as they passed, and
he had to be talking to me since no one else was
around. I glanced up automatically. Two of them had
paused, the other two were slowing. The closest, a
heavyset, dark-haired man in his early twenties,
seemed to be the one who had spoken. He was
wearing a flannel shirt open over a dirty t-shirt, cutoff jeans, and sandals. He took half a step toward me.
"Hello," I mumbled, a knee-jerk reaction. Then I
quickly looked away and walked faster toward the
corner. I could hear them laughing at full volume
behind me.
"Hey, wait!" one of them called after me again, but I
kept my head down and rounded the corner with a
sigh of relief. I could still hear them chortling behind
me.
I found myself on a sidewalk leading past the backs of
several somber-colored warehouses, each with large
167 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
bay doors for unloading trucks, padlocked for the
night. The south side of the street had no sidewalk,
only a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire
protecting some kind of engine parts storage yard. I'd
wandered far past the part of Port Angeles that I, as a
guest, was intended to see. It was getting dark, I
realized, the clouds finally returning, piling up on the
western horizon, creating an early sunset. The
eastern sky was still clear, but graying, shot through
with streaks of pink and orange. I'd left my jacket in
the car, and a sudden shiver made me cross my arms
tightly across my chest. A single van passed me, and
then the road was empty.
The sky suddenly darkened further, and, as I looked
over my shoulder to glare at the offending cloud, I
realized with a shock that two men were walking
quietly twenty feet behind me.
They were from the same group I'd passed at the
corner, though neither was the dark one who'd
spoken to me. I turned my head forward at once,
quickening my pace. A chill that had nothing to do
with the weather made me shiver again. My purse
was on a shoulder strap and I had it slung across my
body, the way you were supposed to wear it so it
wouldn't get snatched. I knew exactly where my
pepper spray was — still in my duffle bag under the
bed, never unpacked. I didn't have much money with
me, just a twenty and some ones, and I thought about
"accidentally" dropping my bag and walking away.
But a small, frightened voice in the back of my mind
warned me that they might be something worse than
thieves. I listened intently to their quiet footsteps,
168 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
which were much too quiet when compared to the
boisterous noise they'd been making earlier, and it
didn't sound like they were speeding up, or getting
any closer to me. Breathe, I had to remind myself.
You don't know they're following you. I continued to
walk as quickly as I could without actually running,
focusing on the right-hand turn that was only a few
yards away from me now. I could hear them, staying
as far back as they'd been before. A blue car turned
onto the street from the south and drove quickly past
me. I thought of jumping out in front of it, but I
hesitated, inhibited, unsure that I was really being
pursued, and then it was too late. I reached the
corner, but a swift glance revealed that it was only a
blind drive to the back of another building. I was halfturned in anticipation; I had to hurriedly correct and
dash across the narrow drive, back to the sidewalk.
The street ended at the next corner, where there was
a stop sign. I concentrated on the faint footsteps
behind me, deciding whether or not to run. They
sounded farther back, though, and I knew they could
outrun me in any case. I was sure to trip and go
sprawling if I tried to go any faster. The footfalls were
definitely farther back. I risked a quick glance over
my shoulder, and they were maybe forty feet back
now, I saw with relief. But they were both staring at
me.
It seemed to take forever for me to get to the corner. I
kept my pace steady, the men behind me falling ever
so slightly farther behind with every step. Maybe they
realized they had scared me and were sorry. I saw two
cars going north pass the intersection I was heading
for, and I exhaled in relief. There would be more
169 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
people around once I got off this deserted street. I
skipped around the corner with a grateful sigh. And
skidded to a stop.
The street was lined on both sides by blank, doorless,
windowless walls. I could see in the distance, two
intersections down, streetlamps, cars, and more
pedestrians, but they were all too far away. Because
lounging against the western building, midway down
the street, were the other two men from the group,
both watching with excited smiles as I froze dead on
the sidewalk. I realized then that I wasn't being
followed. I was being herded.
I paused for only a second, but it felt like a very long
time. I turned then and darted to the other side of the
road. I had a sinking feeling that it was a wasted
attempt. The footsteps behind me were louder now.
"There you are!" The booming voice of the stocky,
dark-haired man shattered the intense quiet and
made me jump. In the gathering darkness, it seemed
like he was looking past me.
"Yeah," a voice called loudly from behind me, making
me jump again as I tried to hurry down the street.
"We just took a little detour." My steps had to slow
now. I was closing the distance between myself and
the lounging pair too quickly. I had a good loud
scream, and I sucked in air, preparing to use it, but
my throat was so dry I wasn't sure how much volume
I could manage. With a quick movement I slipped my
purse over my head, gripping the strap with one
hand, ready to surrender it or use it as weapon as
need demanded.
170 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
The thickset man shrugged away from the wall as I
warily came to a stop, and walked slowly into the
street.
"Stay away from me," I warned in a voice that was
supposed to sound strong and fearless. But I was
right about the dry throat — no volume.
"Don't be like that, sugar," he called, and the raucous
laughter started again behind me.
I braced myself, feet apart, trying to remember
through my panic what little self-defense I knew. Heel
of the hand thrust upward, hopefully breaking the
nose or shoving it into the brain. Finger through the
eye socket — try to hook around and pop the eye out.
And the standard knee to the groin, of course. That
same pessimistic voice in my mind spoke up then,
reminding me that I probably wouldn't have a chance
against one of them, and there were four. Shut up! I
commanded the voice before terror could incapacitate
me. I wasn't going out without taking someone with
me. I tried to swallow so I could build up a decent
scream.
Headlights suddenly flew around the corner, the car
almost hitting the stocky one, forcing him to jump
back toward the sidewalk. I dove into the road — this
car was going to stop, or have to hit me. But the silver
car unexpectedly fishtailed around, skidding to a stop
with the passenger door open just a few feet from me.
"Get in," a furious voice commanded.
It was amazing how instantaneously the choking fear
vanished, amazing how suddenly the feeling of
171 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
security washed over me — even before I was off the
street — as soon as I heard his voice. I jumped into
the seat, slamming the door shut behind me.
It was dark in the car, no light had come on with the
opening of the door, and I could barely see his face in
the glow from the dashboard. The tires squealed as he
spun around to face north, accelerating too quickly,
swerving toward the stunned men on the street. I
caught a glimpse of them diving for the sidewalk as
we straightened out and sped toward the harbor.
"Put on your seat belt," he commanded, and I realized
I was clutching the seat with both hands. I quickly
obeyed; the snap as the belt connected was loud in
the darkness. He took a sharp left, racing forward,
blowing through several stop signs without a pause.
But I felt utterly safe and, for the moment, totally
unconcerned about where we were going. I stared at
his face in profound relief, relief that went beyond my
sudden deliverance. I studied his flawless features in
the limited light, waiting for my breath to return to
normal, until it occurred to me that his expression
was murderously angry.
"Are you okay?" I asked, surprised at how hoarse my
voice sounded.
"No," he said curtly, and his tone was livid.
I sat in silence, watching his face while his blazing
eyes stared straight ahead, until the car came to a
sudden stop. I glanced around, but it was too dark to
see anything beside the vague outline of dark trees
crowding the roadside. We weren't in town anymore.
172 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Bella?" he asked, his voice tight, controlled.
"Yes?" My voice was still rough. I tried to clear my
throat quietly.
"Are you all right?" He still didn't look at me, but the
fury was plain on his face.
"Yes," I croaked softly.
"Distract me, please," he ordered.
"I'm sorry, what?"
He exhaled sharply.
"Just prattle about something unimportant until I
calm down," he clarified, closing his eyes and
pinching the bridge of his nose with his thumb and
forefinger.
"Um." I wracked my brain for something trivial. "I'm
going to run over Tyler Crowley tomorrow before
school?"
He was still squeezing his eyes closed, but the corner
of his mouth twitched.
"Why?"
"He's telling everyone that he's taking me to prom —
either he's insane or he's still trying to make up for
almost killing me last… well, you remember it, and he
thinks prom is somehow the correct way to do this.
So I figure if I endanger his life, then we're even, and
he can't keep trying to make amends. I don't need
enemies and maybe Lauren would back off if he left
me alone. I might have to total his Sentra, though. If
173 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
he doesn't have a ride he can't take anyone to
prom…" I babbled on.
"I heard about that." He sounded a bit more
composed.
"You did?" I asked in disbelief, my previous irritation
flaring. "If he's paralyzed from the neck down, he
can't go to the prom, either," I muttered, refining my
plan.
Edward sighed, and finally opened his eyes.
"Better?"
"Not really."
I waited, but he didn't speak again. He leaned his
head back against the seat, staring at the ceiling of
the car. His face was rigid.
"What's wrong?" My voice came out in a whisper.
"Sometimes I have a problem with my temper, Bella."
He was whispering, too, and as he stared out the
window, his eyes narrowed into slits. "But it wouldn't
be helpful for me to turn around and hunt down
those…" He didn't finish his sentence, looking away,
struggling for a moment to control his anger again.
"At least," he continued, "that's what I'm trying to
convince myself."
"Oh." The word seemed inadequate, but I couldn't
think of a better response.
We sat in silence again. I glanced at the clock on the
dashboard. It was past six-thirty.
174 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Jessica and Angela will be worried," I murmured. "I
was supposed to meet them."
He started the engine without another word, turning
around smoothly and speeding back toward town. We
were under the streetlights in no time at all, still
going too fast, weaving with ease through the cars
slowly cruising the boardwalk. He parallel-parked
against the curb in a space I would have thought
much too small for the Volvo, but he slid in
effortlessly in one try. I looked out the window to see
the lights of La Bella Italia, and Jess and Angela just
leaving, pacing anxiously away from us.
"How did you know where… ?" I began, but then I just
shook my head. I heard the door open and turned to
see him getting out.
"What are you doing?" I asked.
"I'm taking you to dinner." He smiled slightly, but his
eyes were hard. He stepped out of the car and
slammed the door. I fumbled with my seat belt, and
then hurried to get out of the car as well. He was
waiting for me on the sidewalk.
He spoke before I could. "Go stop Jessica and Angela
before I have to track them down, too. I don't think I
could restrain myself if I ran into your other friends
again."
I shivered at the threat in his voice.
"Jess! Angela!" I yelled after them, waving when they
turned. They rushed back to me, the pronounced
relief on both their faces simultaneously changing to
175 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
surprise as they saw who I was standing next to. They
hesitated a few feet from us.
"Where have you been?" Jessica's voice was
suspicious.
"I got lost," I admitted sheepishly. "And then I ran into
Edward." I gestured toward him.
"Would it be all right if I joined you?" he asked in his
silken, irresistible voice. I could see from their
staggered expressions that he had never unleashed
his talents on them before.
"Er… sure," Jessica breathed.
"Um, actually, Bella, we already ate while we were
waiting — sorry," Angela confessed.
"That's fine — I'm not hungry." I shrugged.
"I think you should eat something." Edward's voice
was low, but full of authority. He looked up at Jessica
and spoke slightly louder. "Do you mind if I drive
Bella home tonight? That way you won't have to wait
while she eats."
"Uh, no problem, I guess…" She bit her lip, trying to
figure out from my expression whether that was what
I wanted. I winked at her. I wanted nothing more than
to be alone with my perpetual savior. There were so
many questions that I couldn't bombard him with till
we were by ourselves.
"Okay." Angela was quicker than Jessica. "See you
tomorrow, Bella…
176 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
Edward." She grabbed Jessica's hand and pulled her
toward the car, which I could see a little ways away,
parked across First Street. As they got in, Jess turned
and waved, her face eager with curiosity. I waved
back, waiting for them to drive away before I turned
to face him.
"Honestly, I'm not hungry," I insisted, looking up to
scrutinize his face. His expression was unreadable.
"Humor me."
He walked to the door of the restaurant and held it
open with an obstinate expression. Obviously, there
would be no further discussion. I walked past him
into the restaurant with a resigned sigh. The
restaurant wasn't crowded — it was the off-season in
Port Angeles. The host was female, and I understood
the look in her eyes as she assessed Edward. She
welcomed him a little more warmly than necessary. I
was surprised by how much that bothered me. She
was several inches taller than I was, and unnaturally
blond.
"A table for two?" His voice was alluring, whether he
was aiming for that or not. I saw her eyes flicker to
me and then away, satisfied by my obvious
ordinariness, and by the cautious, no-contact space
Edward kept between us. She led us to a table big
enough for four in the center of the most crowded
area of the dining floor.
I was about to sit, but Edward shook his head at me.
"Perhaps something more private?" he insisted quietly
to the host. I wasn't sure, but it looked like he
177 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
smoothly handed her a tip. I'd never seen anyone
refuse a table except in old movies.
"Sure." She sounded as surprised as I was. She
turned and led us around a partition to a small ring
of booths — all of them empty. "How's this?"
"Perfect." He flashed his gleaming smile, dazing her
momentarily.
"Um" — she shook her head, blinking — "your server
will be right out." She walked away unsteadily.
"You really shouldn't do that to people," I criticized.
"It's hardly fair."
"Do what?"
"Dazzle them like that — she's probably
hyperventilating in the kitchen right now."
He seemed confused.
"Oh, come on," I said dubiously. "You have to know
the effect you have on people."
He tilted his head to one side, and his eyes were
curious. "I dazzle people?"
"You haven't noticed? Do you think everybody gets
their way so easily?" He ignored my questions. "Do I
dazzle you?"
"Frequently," I admitted.
And then our server arrived, her face expectant. The
hostess had definitely dished behind the scenes, and
this new girl didn't look disappointed. She flipped a
178 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
strand of short black hair behind one ear and smiled
with unnecessary warmth.
"Hello. My name is Amber, and I'll be your server
tonight. What can I get you to drink?" I didn't miss
that she was speaking only to him. He looked at me.
"I'll have a Coke." It sounded like a question.
"Two Cokes," he said.
"I'll be right back with that," she assured him with
another unnecessary smile. But he didn't see it. He
was watching me.
"What?" I asked when she left.
His eyes stayed fixed on my face. "How are you
feeling?"
"I'm fine," I replied, surprised by his intensity.
"You don't feel dizzy, sick, cold… ?"
"Should I?"
He chuckled at my puzzled tone.
"Well, I'm actually waiting for you to go into shock."
His face twisted up into that perfect crooked smile.
"I don't think that will happen," I said after I could
breathe again.
"I've always been very good at repressing unpleasant
things."
"Just the same, I'll feel better when you have some
sugar and food in you."
179 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
Right on cue, the waitress appeared with our drinks
and a basket of breadsticks. She stood with her back
to me as she placed them on the table.
"Are you ready to order?" she asked Edward.
"Bella?" he asked. She turned unwillingly toward me.
I picked the first thing I saw on the menu. "Um… I'll
have the mushroom ravioli."
"And you?" She turned back to him with a smile.
"Nothing for me," he said. Of course not.
"Let me know if you change your mind." The coy smile
was still in place, but he wasn't looking at her, and
she left dissatisfied.
"Drink," he ordered.
I sipped at my soda obediently, and then drank more
deeply, surprised by how thirsty I was. I realized I had
finished the whole thing when he pushed his glass
toward me.
"Thanks," I muttered, still thirsty. The cold from the
icy soda was radiating through my chest, and I
shivered.
"Are you cold?"
"It's just the Coke," I explained, shivering again.
"Don't you have a jacket?" His voice was disapproving.
"Yes." I looked at the empty bench next to me. "Oh —
I left it in Jessica's car," I realized.
180 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
Edward was shrugging out of his jacket. I suddenly
realized that I had never once noticed what he was
wearing — not just tonight, but ever. I just couldn't
seem to look away from his face. I made myself look
now, focusing. He was removing a light beige leather
jacket now; underneath he wore an ivory turtleneck
sweater. It fit him snugly, emphasizing how muscular
his chest was.
He handed me the jacket, interrupting my ogling.
"Thanks," I said again, sliding my arms into his
jacket. It was cold —
the way my jacket felt when I first picked it up in the
morning, hanging in the drafty hallway. I shivered
again. It smelled amazing. I inhaled, trying to identify
the delicious scent. It didn't smell like cologne. The
sleeves were much too long; I shoved them back so I
could free my hands.
"That color blue looks lovely with your skin," he said,
watching me. I was surprised; I looked down,
flushing, of course.
He pushed the bread basket toward me.
"Really, I'm not going into shock," I protested.
"You should be — a normal person would be. You
don't even look shaken." He seemed unsettled. He
stared into my eyes, and I saw how light his eyes
were, lighter than I'd ever seen them, golden
butterscotch.
"I feel very safe with you," I confessed, mesmerized
into telling the truth again.
181 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
That displeased him; his alabaster brow furrowed. He
shook his head, frowning.
"This is more complicated than I'd planned," he
murmured to himself. I picked up a breadstick and
began nibbling on the end, measuring his expression.
I wondered when it would be okay to start questioning
him.
"Usually you're in a better mood when your eyes are
so light," I commented, trying to distract him from
whatever thought had left him frowning and somber.
He stared at me, stunned. "What?"
"You're always crabbier when your eyes are black — I
expect it then," I went on. "I have a theory about
that."
His eyes narrowed. "More theories?"
"Mm-hm." I chewed on a small bite of the bread,
trying to look indifferent.
"I hope you were more creative this time… or are you
still stealing from comic books?" His faint smile was
mocking; his eyes were still tight.
"Well, no, I didn't get it from a comic book, but I
didn't come up with it on my own, either," I
confessed.
"And?" he prompted.
But then the waitress strode around the partition
with my food. I realized we'd been unconsciously
leaning toward each other across the table, because
182 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
we both straightened up as she approached. She set
the dish in front of me — it looked pretty good — and
turned quickly to Edward.
"Did you change your mind?" she asked. "Isn't there
anything I can get you?" I may have been imagining
the double meaning in her words.
"No, thank you, but some more soda would be nice."
He gestured with a long white hand to the empty cups
in front of me.
"Sure." She removed the empty glasses and walked
away.
"You were saying?" he asked.
"I'll tell you about it in the car. If…" I paused.
"There are conditions?" He raised one eyebrow, his
voice ominous.
"I do have a few questions, of course."
"Of course."
The waitress was back with two more Cokes. She sat
them down without a word this time, and left again.
I took a sip.
"Well, go ahead," he pushed, his voice still hard. I
started with the most undemanding. Or so I thought.
"Why are you in Port Angeles?"
He looked down, folding his large hands together
slowly on the table. His eyes flickered up at me from
under his lashes, the hint of a smirk on his face.
183 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
"Next."
"But that's the easiest one," I objected.
"Next," he repeated.
I looked down, frustrated. I unrolled my silverware,
picked up my fork, and carefully speared a ravioli. I
put it in my mouth slowly, still looking down, chewing
while I thought. The mushrooms were good. I
swallowed and took another sip of Coke before I
looked up.
"Okay, then." I glared at him, and continued slowly.
"Let's say, hypothetically of course, that… someone…
could know what people are thinking, read minds,
you know — with a few exceptions."
"Just one exception," he corrected, "hypothetically."
"All right, with one exception, then." I was thrilled
that he was playing along, but I tried to seem casual.
"How does that work? What are the limitations? How
would… that someone…
find someone else at exactly the right time? How
would he know she was in trouble?" I wondered if my
convoluted questions even made sense.
"Hypothetically?" he asked.
"Sure."
"Well, if… that someone…"
"Let's call him 'Joe,'" I suggested.
184 | P a g e Twilight – Stephanie Meyer
He smiled wryly. "Joe, then. If Joe had been paying
attention, the timing wouldn't have needed to be quite
so exact." He shook his head, rolling his eyes. "Only
you could get into trouble in a town this small. You
would have devastated their crime rate statistics for a
decade, you know."
"We were speaking of a hypothetical case," I reminded
him frostily. He laughed at me, his eyes warm.
"Yes, we were," he agreed. "Shall we call you 'Jane'?"
"How did you know?" I asked, unable to curb my
intensity. I realized I was leaning toward him again.
He seemed to be wavering, torn by some internal
dilemma. His eyes locked with mine, and I guessed he
was making the decision right then whether or not to
simply tell me the truth.
"You can trust me, you know," I murmured. I reached
forward, without thinking, to touch his folded hands,
but he slid them away minutely, and I pulled my
hand back.
"I don't know if I have a choice anymore." His voice
was almost a whisper. "I was wrong — you're much
more observant than I gave you credit for."
"I thought you were always right."
"I used to be." He shook his head again. "I was wrong
about you on one other thing, as well. You're not a
magnet for accidents — that's not a broad enough
classification. You are a magnet for trouble. If there is
anything dangerous within a ten-mile radius, it will
invariably find you."
